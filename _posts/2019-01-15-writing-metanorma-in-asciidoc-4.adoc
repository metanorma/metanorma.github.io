= Writing in AsciiDoc, Part&nbsp;4

In our foregoing discussion, we have presented how to mark up standards documents
for Metanorma using AsciiDoc markup. Two types of section have specialized
content, which requires additional markup: _Terms and definitions_, and _Bibliographies_.

== Bibliographies

=== Bibliographies

We have already seen an example of how bibliographies are marked up in
link:/blog/12-15-2018/writing-metanorma-in-asciidoc-2/[Part 2 of this series]:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[infobib]]
[bibliography,obligation=informative]
== Informative Bibliography

* [[[ISO3696,ISO 3696]]], _Water for analytical laboratory use -- Specification and test methods_

== Next heading...
--

References are provided as a list of bibliographic anchors (in triple brackets, to differentiate
them from normal internal cross-reference anchors, which are in double brackets). The bibliographic
anchor is followed by a comma, and then the title of the reference. As we have noted,
the section containing such bibliographic anchors must have the style attribute `bibliography`,
to be processed by Metanorma AsciiDoc correctly.

Any bibliographic anchor must consist of a cross-reference token (without spaces), which
is how the reference will be cited within Metanorma AsciiDoc, and the official code used to refer to the
document as a standard, separated by a comma. The cross-reference token is arbitrary, and does
not need to correspond to the document code at all: `+[[[ref33,ISO 3696]]]+` would work just as well.

On the other hand, the document code is used to fetch the current correct reference to the standards
document where the bibliography is accessible online.
For that reason, the document code needs to be correct, or else the right
document will not be retrieved. In the case of ISO, IEC, and GB, the code is also expected to
contain references to part numbers, if only a document part is cited, and to the year, if
a specific edition of the standard is cited; so `+[[[a,ISO 3166-2:2007]]]+` refers to the 2007
edition of https://www.iso.org/standard/39718.html[ISO standard 3166, part 2],
and `+[[[b,GB/T 1.1-2009]]]+` refers to the 2009 edition of GB/T standard 1, part 1.

If the document is not a standard but a generic reference, the document code is replaced by a number;
for example,

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ref10,10]]] [smallcap]#Standard No I.C.C 167#. _Determination of the protein content in cereal and cereal products for food and animal feeding stuffs according to the Dumas combustion method_ (see http://www.icc.or.at)
--

Any number of sections can be marked up as bibliographies with the style attribute `bibliography`.
Following ISO practice, there are usually two bibliographies in a standards document: a "Normative
References" section, which contains references to documents with normative effect (almost always
standards); and a general "Bibliography", which contains references to documents with informative
effect. Under ISO, these two bibliographies are rendered differently, and appear in different locations
of the document.

=== Relaton

The https://github.com/relaton/relaton/[`relaton` family of gems] is used to fetch references where available from online bibliographies;
it is used within Metanorma to update any bibliographic references with the current correct title.
It is currently implemented for https://www.iso.org[ISO], https://www.iec.ch[IEC], https://www.ietf.org[IETF],
and the GB family of standards. The bibliographic
entries it fetches online are cached locally, to avoid time-consuming refetching when the Metanorma
document is re-compiled. (You will notice that when you first compile a document, each reference can
take several seconds to resolve.)

By default two caches are created by `relaton`:

* one global cache, storing all accesses to `relaton` (by default `~/.relaton/cache`), and
* one cache specific to the documents in the current directory (by default `relaton/cache`).

The caches contain one file for each accessed document,
encoded in an XML schema specific to Relaton; you can edit the files, and reuse them between
documents. The
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/blob/main/README.adoc#document-attributes[metanorma-standoc document attributes]
document how to override this behaviour, including not permitting `relaton` to resolve references
at all.

In order to work out which website to fetch a reference from, the `relaton` gem needs to know
what kind of standard is being referenced. ISO and IEC references always have their code prefixed
by `ISO` and `IEC`; Relaton also recognizes that codes starting with `RFC` are IETF references,
and that codes starting with `GB` are GB references. However, to remove ambiguity, and to deal
with other document prefixes, the code provided can be wrapped in a prefix specific to the standards body:
`IETF(I-D.ribose-asciirfc-08)` identifies `I-D.ribose-asciirfc-08` as an IETF standard (an
Internet Draft), while `CN(GM/T 0009-2012)` is the Chinese sector standard GM/T 0009-2012.

The https://github.com/relaton/relaton-cli[relaton-cli] tool exposes various functions of
`relaton` to the command line.

Specifically, this command fetches a document with document code _CODE_ as Relaton XML.:

[source,sh]
----
relaton fetch CODE -t TYPE -y YEAR
----

The accepted _TYPE_'s are one of:

* `iso`, through the https://github.com/metanorma/isobib[`isobib` gem],
* `ietf`, through the https://github.com/metanorma/isobib[`ietfbib` gem],
* `iec`, through the https://github.com/metanorma/isobib[`iecbib` gem],
* `gb`, through the https://github.com/metanorma/isobib[`gbbib` gem]

The tool can also extract Relaton XML references from Metanorma documents, and it can convert
Relaton XML to HTML, which allows a set of references (including a set of references to Metanorma
documents) to be displayed as an HTML file.

=== Citations

A citation to a reference is marked up in Metanorma AsciiDoc the same way as an internal cross-reference,
in `+<< >>+`; so if you have a reference defined as `+[[[ref33,ISO 3696]]]+`, the element
`+<<ref33>>+` is a reference to https://www.iso.org/standard/9169.html[ISO 3696].
If you provide a cross-reference without a corresponding
reference, Metanorma will issue a warning.

In Metanorma AsciiDoc, you can provide display text within a cross-reference, after a comma; so
`+<<ref33,the aforementioned standard>>+` would be rendered as "the aforementioned standard".
Metanorma AsciiDoc uses the display text to convey references to a specific location
within a document, by using pairs of defined location names (_clause, table, figure_ etc.)
and numbers or number ranges. So `+<<ref33,clause 3,table 3,page 7-9>>+` will be rendered as
"ISO 3696, Clause 3, Table 3, Page 7-9". Within ISO documents in particular, subclause
references are not prefixed by "Clause"; so `+<<ref33,clause 3.1>>+` will be rendered as
"ISO 3696, 3.1".

== Terms and Definitions

Most standards documents have a section discussing the terms and definitions used in the
document. These can often be a mere glossary of terms, which can be handled adequately as
a definition list.

However Metanorma tries to deal with as much complexity as you are likely to find in
common standards formats. ISO and IEC in particular provide a rich amount of information
in their Terms and Definitions sections, including alternate and deprecated synonyms for
the term being defined; the domain of the term (to be used in case of disambiguation);
related notes and examples; and the source from which the term has been taken, where
applicable. Moreover, https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO/IEC DIR 2],
which prescribes the structure of ISO and IEC standards
documents, imposes a strict structure on how this information will be presented.

Metanorma supports the ISO/IEC structure of Terms and Definitions by using macros,
which are used to provide the requisite semantic information (for alternate, deprecated,
and domain markup). A term itself is marked up as a terminal subclause of a Terms and Definitions
section (so identified by its title): the term is treated as a term, rather than a subclause,
unless it has the style attribute `[.nonterm]`:

[source,asciidoc]

== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Introduction
The following terms have non-normative effect, and should be ignored by the ametrical.

[[paddy]]
=== paddy
alt:[paddy rice]
alt:[rough rice]
deprecated:[cargo rice]
domain:[rice]

rice retaining its husk after threshing

[example]
Foreign seeds, husks, bran, sand, dust.

NOTE: The starch of waxy rice consists almost entirely of amylopectin. The kernels have a tendency to stick together after cooking.

[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>, The term "cargo rice" is shown as deprecated,
and Note 1 to entry is not included here
--

This example consists of an introduction (which is a subclause rather than a
term), and the term _paddy_. The term has the synonyms _paddy rice_ and
_rough rice_, the deprecated synonym _cargo rice_, and is associated with
the domain _rice_, to disambiguate it from other instances of the term _paddy_.
The definition is the paragraph following from the header and synonyms;
it can be followed by one or more examples, one or more notes, and a source
paragraph.

The source paragraph is expected to start with the citation of
the reference that the term is taken for, optionally followed by text indicating
how that definition is to be modified for this document. The citation follows
the convention already discussed, of using a reference anchor for a reference
given in the bibliography, followed by a location within the document.

Often in ISO and IEC the http://www.electropedia.org[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary]
is treated as a source of terms and definitions. The IEV corresponds to a large number
of IEC 60050 standards, one part per subject area, and each with a different publication year.
Rather than require authors to track each subject area separately, Metanorma allows
citations to the dummy reference IEV (e.g. `+[[[iev,IEV]]]+`): each individual reference
to an IEV term (e.g. `+<<iev,clause 113-01-01>>+` for
http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=113-01-01["`space-time`"])
is converted to a reference to the specific publication (in this case, IEC 60050-113:2011),
and the bibliography is appropriately updated.
