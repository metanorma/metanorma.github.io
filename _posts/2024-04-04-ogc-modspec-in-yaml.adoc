  Take advantage of the `yaml2text` template capabilities to encode large
  amounts of ModSpec instances in fewer lines of markup.
---

== Purpose

OGC standards use ModSpec to encode requirements, and sometimes there are a lot
of them. ISO/TC 211 has also begun to encode requirements in the OGC ModSpec
fashion.

`yaml2text` is a Metanorma plugin that allows you to encode large amounts of
data that share the same structure in a reduced number of lines via pre-defined
template. The data is to be arranged in YAML format, and the template, written
in Liquid.

The main goal of this article is to introduce you on the application of
`yaml2text` to encode ModSpec instances.

To read this article you have to be familiar with the encoding basics of
`yaml2text` and ModSpec instances in Metanorma. For that matter, it is
recommended to first read these before continuing:

* link:/author/topics/automation/yaml_to_text/[`yaml2text` plugin]


== Encoding requirements with `yaml2text`

In order to ensure an expeditious process in the use of `yaml2text`,
and to avoid code repetition, follow the next steps:

. Place and arrange all the requirements data into a YAML file.

. Write the template in Liquid and save it in a separate `.liquid` file.

. Create the `yaml2text` block in the Metanorma document specifying
the corresponding YAML file, and including the liquid template using
the `include::` directive.

. Compile the document to test the correct rendering of the requirements;
debug if necessary.

Now, let's look at two examples: a simple one and larger one.


=== Encoding a simple requirement

link:/author/topics/blocks/requirements-modspec/[OGC ModSpec instances] are
typically encoded as a definition list.

NOTE: There are two methods to encode requirements: as a definition list or as
attributes. We adopt the recommended practice of the definition list here.

In this example, we want to encode the following **Requirement** using `yaml2text`.

[[simple-req]]
.Sample requirement to be encoded
|===
2+^|*Requirement 1*

|Identifier |`/req/relief/classes`
|Statement | For each UML class defined or referenced in the Relief Package:
|A | The Implementation Specification SHALL contain an element which represents the
same concept as that defined for the UML class.
|B | The Implementation Specification SHALL represent associations with the same
source, target, direction, roles, and multiplicities as those of the UML class.
|===

First, we define the *data file*.
The data file represents the requirement using a fixed structure in YAML.
Let's call it `data.yaml`.

.YAML file `data.yaml` representing the <<simple-req>>
[source,yaml]
----
---
identifier: /req/relief/classes
statement: "For each UML class defined or referenced in the Relief Package:"
parts:
- The Implementation Specification SHALL contain an element which represents the
same concept as that defined for the UML class.
- The Implementation Specification SHALL represent associations with the same
source, target, direction, roles, and multiplicities as those of the UML class.
----

In YAML, data is represented using key-value pairs. Also note that we used
array representation for the `parts` field. This is how is done when we have
several elements mapped to a single field.

Once we have our data properly structured in YAML, we proceed to write the
template in Liquid.

We could write our liquid template directly in the `yaml2text` block,
but it is good practice to do so in a separate file, the *template file*.
Let's call this file `template.liquid`.

`yaml2text` requires naming a `context` variable that will represent the
totality of the data saved in the YAML file. Let's call this variable `context`.

Having all set, the template is defined as follows:

.Template file `template.liquid` for rendering the <<simple-req>>
[source,liquid]
----
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {{ context.identifier }}
statement:: {{ context.statement }}

{% for part in context.parts %}
part:: {{ part }}
{% endfor %}
====
----

[NOTE]
====
In Liquid, arrays are typically handled with _for_ loops:

[source%unnumbered,liquid]
----
{% for element in elements %}
//... content ...
{% endfor %}
----
====

With the *data file* and the *template file*, we proceed to create the
`yaml2text` block in our Metanorma document:

[[simple-req-yaml2text]]
.Definition of the `yaml2text` block encoding the <<simple-req>>
[source,asciidoc]
----
[yaml2text,data.yaml,context] <1>
--
\include::template.liquid[] <2>
--
----
<1> The *data file* `data.yaml` is passed into the block.
<2> The *template file* `template.liquid` receives the `context` variable
from the block.

Here, we have assumed that `data.yaml` and `template.liquid` are in the same
location as the Metanorma document. Remember that the path to these files is
calculated based on relative location.

At this point, we can compile the document to check if the requirement
renders correctly. Note that for such small template, we could place the code right
inside of the `yaml2text` block without the need for the `include` directive.
But we do this mainly to avoid code repetition in subsequent blocks.

Once Metanorma processes the Liquid template, the `yaml2text` block
will result in this content:

.Output of the `yaml2text` processed block
[source,asciidoc]
----
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/relief/classes
statement:: For each UML class defined or referenced in the Relief Package:
part:: The Implementation Specification SHALL contain an element which represents the
same concept as that defined for the UML class.
part:: The Implementation Specification SHALL represent associations with the same
source, target, direction, roles, and multiplicities as those of the UML class.
====
----

That's it! The process to encode a requirement using `yaml2text` is that simple.

Now, let's investigate a more complex example.


=== Encoding a Conformance class with embedded Conformance tests

In ModSpec, **Conformance class**es contains **Conformance test**s.

The challenge in managing them is that the Conformance class links to individual
Conformance tests, the individual Conformance tests also have to link back to
the Conformance class. Hence we opt to encode all of them a single YAML file.

Let's encode a Conformance class that is already defined by this YAML markup.

NOTE: This is a real example from the source files of
the published https://www.iso.org/standard/80874.html[ISO 19115-3:2023].

[[cc-ex-yaml]]
.Data file `data.yaml` of a Conformance class instance arranged in YAML format
[source,yaml]
----
---
conformance_classes:
- name: Validation of XML instance for metadata basic information
  identifier: https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/conf/metadata-xml/basic
  target: https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/req/metadata-xml/basic
  dependencies:
  - https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/conf/metadata-minimal-xml
  - https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/conf/metadata-xml/common
  - https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/conf/metadata-xml/multilingual
  tests:
  - name: Validate with XSD
    identifier: https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/conf/metadata-xml/basic/schema-valid
    targets:
    - https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/req/metadata-xml/basic/valid
    method: Validate with metadataBase.xsd
  - name: Verify presence of identification information
    identifier: https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/conf/metadata-xml/basic/identification
    targets:
    - https://standards.isotc211.org/19115/-1/1/req/metadata-xml/basic/identification
    method: |
      Inspection to determine that the element populating the "identification"
      property is defined in the substitution group for
      Abstract_ResourceDescription.
----

In this arrangement, the `conformance_classes` field is meant to bundle several
Conformance classes. Here only one Conformance class is shown.

Each Conformance class has the following components:

* `name`
* `identifier`
* `target`
* several `dependencies` (array)
* several `tests` (array)

Under `tests`, each Conformance test is composed of:

* `name`
* `identifier`
* `target` (array)
* `method`

Once the structure of the data is well-understood, we can proceed to write the
Liquid template.

As above, we define `context` as the context variable.

[[cc-ex-liquid]]
.Template file `template.liquid` that renders the Conformance class and Conformance tests
[source,liquid]
----
{% for scope in context.conformance_classes %}

.{{scope.name}}
[conformance_class]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {{scope.identifier}}
target:: {{scope.target}}

{% for depend in {{scope.dependencies}} %}
inherit:: {{depend}}
{% endfor %}

{% for test in {{scope.tests}} %}
conformance-test:: {{test.identifier}}
{% endfor %}
====

{% for test in {{scope.tests}} %}
{% if {{test.name}} %}
.{{test.name}}
{% endif %}
[conformance_test]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: {{test.identifier}}

{% for target in {{test.targets}} %}
target:: {{target}}

{% endfor %}

{% for depend in {{test.dependencies}} %}
inherit:: {{depend}}
{% endfor %}

{% if {{test.method}} %}
test-method::
+
--
{{test.method}}
--
{% endif %}
====

{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
----

Multiple _if_ statements are used to verify the presence of data in fields.
This is necessary when dealing with multiple requirement instances.

This template, assumed to be saved as `template.liquid` file at the same
location as the Metanorma file, is to be included in a `yaml2text` block inside
the Metanorma document.

.`yaml2text` block that encodes Conformance classes and Conformance tests
[source,asciidoc]
----
[yaml2text,data.yaml,context]
--
\include::template.liquid[]
--
----

From here, we can compile the document to verify its correct rendering,
and debug if necessary.

This process is equally applicable to any other ModSpec instances, including
Recommendations and Permissions.


== External resources

Thanks to https://www.ogc.org[OGC],
the https://www.ogc.org/standard/geopose/[OGC GeoPose] document
(https://github.com/metanorma/ogc-GeoPose[GitHub]) is an open-source, fully
fledged example of this approach in encoding Requirements and Conformance
classes.

Since it is a real-life example, the templates provided there are more generic
and comprehensive (aka longer) than what we have explained here. The
fundamentals, however, are the same as what is explained in this post.
