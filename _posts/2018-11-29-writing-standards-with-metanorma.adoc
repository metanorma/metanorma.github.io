= What Metanorma is for

So. *Why Metanorma*?

== Standardization documents are complex

If you're in the business of writing standards documents, you are in
the business of writing some of the most complicated documents there
are.

* You are working on a document that is being *edited by committee*.

* You need *formal accountability and tracking* for each of the edits
that committee is making to the document.

* You need to deal with *references and bibliographies*.

* You need to deal with *lots of headings and subheadings*.

* You need to deal with *lots of numbered tables and figures and
examples and notes*.

* You need to deal with *cross-references* to lots of headings and
subheadings. *And tables and figures and examples and notes*.

* You need to deal with the fact that the committee is going to be
wanting to add and remove content from the document. Which means you
have to make sure all those *cross-references to headings and subheadings
and tables and figures and examples and notes are renumbered
automatically*.

* You often need to deal with *complex (or even not-so-complex)
mathematical typesetting*.

* You need to deal with *predefined text required* by the standards
body, and make sure it doesn't deviate from the required wording, but
is also up to date.


No, I'm not done yet.

* You have to *align to a fixed structure* of the document, and you need
to know when the document deviates from that structure.

* You have to *provide document metadata*, such as keywords, working
groups, and related standards, which is accurate and searchable.

* You have to *align to style guides for standards*, which in some
instances (certainly including https://www.iso.org[ISO]) are
detailed and exacting.

* And on top of all of that, you have to *make sure that the document is
formatted in a way that at least somewhat resembles what the standards
body expects to see*.


And for most of you, your tool for doing all of this...

\... is https://products.office.com/en/word[*Microsoft Word*].

*Microsoft Word works fine... until it doesn't.* Documents of the
complexity that standards documents can reach are where it stops
working. *And when it stops working, it crashes*.

NOTE: And keeps on crashing.
And crashes until you're forced to split your document into three
pieces, and dread ever opening it up to edit it. (Which, this being a
standards document, is going to be _All The Time_.)

Some of you reading are already nodding sadly. And *if it doesn't
crash, it still does random stuff in your document*. If you've ever
had two ordered lists in a Word document, you will eventually come
to select "`Restart Numbering`" on the second list.

And that's before you even get into features like *automated
cross-references*. Word does implement those. And they are *one more
thing to go wrong when Word crashes*.

And that, in turn, is before you get into features that Word does not
and cannot implement. *Automated checks of the structure* of your
document, for example. Yes, your standards body has likely issued you
with a Word template to populate, complete with Styles and Fields.
Anyone who has ever received such a template back from authors knows
that *they are going to spend almost as much time cleaning the document
up, as if the author had not used a template to begin with*.

Surely, there should be a better way.

== A better way of authoring

If you're in the IT-minded community, you know that there are, in fact,
better ways. You can use https://www.openoffice.org[OpenOffice] or
https://www.libreoffice.org[LibreOffice], for example, the
open source alternatives to Word, which are often more stable than Word
itself. But that only solves part of the problem with editing standards
documents: *formatting still ends up substantially manual, content is
still not truly validated, tracking changes in document still ends up
overwhelming*.

The real solution, as those in the IT-minded community will tell you,
is to *step away from the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG[WYSIWYG]-style editor* (a
conventional word processor). They work great for most classes of
document, particularly if those documents are not particularly complex.
But there are also things you can't do with binaries, that are much
easier to do with text. In particular, a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM[WYSIWYM]-style editor (a document
processor): not "`What You See Is What You Get`" (where what you see as
you type is meant to look like the formatted end product), but
*"`What You See Is What You Mean`"*, where what you see on the screen is the
text, and instructions on how to format the text -- but not the text
itself.

[quote,Wikipedia on WYSIWYM,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM]
____
In a WYSIWYM editor, *the user writes the contents in a structured way,
marking the content according to its meaning*, its significance in the
document, leaving its final appearance up to one or more separate style
sheets. [...] The editor also needs a system for exporting structured
content to generate the document's final format, following the
indicated structure.

The main advantage of this system is the *total separation of
presentation and content*: users can *structure and write the document
once, rather than repeatedly altering it for each mode of presentation*,
which is left to the export system.
____

*Metanorma solves these issues using the WYSIWYM approach*:

* If authors are only creating marked up text, that deals primarily
with the content, then *they don't need to be overwhelmed with the
business of formatting*; and they don't need to be exposed to the
instability or fiddling that live formatting of text introduces.

* The formatting can come later; and the *formatting can be automated,
which better meets the requirements of formal mandated document styles
â€” such as what standards bodies like to see*. It also means that the
standards bodies have a much better guarantee of the documents being
formatted consistently.

* If a document system has direct access to the content text, it
becomes *much easier to validate it, with rules specific to the
standards body*.

* If the document is text and not a binary, then *tracking changes and
versions of documents becomes a much easier problem*. In particular,
tracking changes and versions of documents can now use the tools
already long established for doing the same job with computer code.

* As the document content is updated (and, because you're writing a
standards document, it will be), the *formatting and presentation of the
document is updated much more smoothly*. *Cross-references will keep
pointing to the right place, predefined text will be automatically
adjusted, lists and notes will be auto-numbered without you needing to
keep a tally sheet*.

*Sounds like a god-send. And in fact, it is a god-send*, if your document
is the right kind of document -- which is why people in the physical
and mathematical sciences (and computer science by extension) can go
through life without installing Microsoft Word, and use document
processors instead, like https://www.latex-project.org/[LaTeX],
https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown],
https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc],
https://docbook.org[DocBook], and
https://www.w3.org/html/[HTML].


== The right tool for the right job

So why haven't we all switched already?

Because most of us, *most of the time, don't edit the right kind of document*.
For the kinds of document we normally edit, a text-based
document editor with a side-arm that does rendering is overkill. It
means we have to give up on the immediate feedback of seeing the text
with the formatting we want applied to it, and instead we have to
remember a whole lot of formatting codes. It means we have to get
familiar with the command line on our computers; and if you don't
already spend your day with the command line prompt, it's a big ask to
start doing so just for document editing. Most of the time, Word is
more than good enough.

But you're reading this because *standards documents are not
most-of-the-time kinds of documents*. And you need something more
structured and rigorous, to deal with the *highly structured and
rigorous, and complex, and uniformly formatted documents* that standards
bodies expect to see.

In generating these documents, you sacrifice spontaneity and creativity
and freedom in your formatting and in how your content is arranged,
because that's the kind of document you're authoring.

NOTE: It might be fairer to say: you're directing your creativity and
freedom away from the formatting, and towards the problem-solving
you're writing about.

Writing a document in a more rigorous system, without WYSIWYG
formatting, is going to be noticeably different: you are not going to
be as free to do whatever you want to do with formatting, or with how
your content is arranged.

But if you wanted *that* kind of freedom, you wouldn't be involved in
standards documents, would you.


== The Metanorma audience

*The Metanorma tool suite has been developed to support the needs of
standards document production*. A lot of the structures it represents
originate from ISO, because of how exacting and widely used the ISO
approach to standards documents is. But Metanorma strives to capture *as
general a model of standards documents* as possible, and to *offer all
standards bodies support* in their document generation process -- *to
make their documents consistent, compliant, and correct*.

Metanorma has a Latin motto (which may be a little
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts[Hogwartian] these
days); that motto is *_Aequitate Verum_*. *"`Truth Through Equity`"*.
Truth is not a straightforward thing to move towards; especially not if
you've only ever used Word, and the command line is foreign territory
to you. And the Metanorma tool suite is not for everyone, or for every
document type: there are plenty of contexts where the adjustment just
isn't worth it.

*But if*:

* your document generation process relies on *Word templates no-one uses correctly*, and
* your committees are resorting to *vetoing all standards proposals*
just so you can guarantee they can be *proofread a second time*

Then it might just be worth your while link:/blog/12-05-2018/intro-to-metanorma/[to try something different].
