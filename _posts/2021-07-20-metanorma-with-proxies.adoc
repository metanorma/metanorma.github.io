  Metanorma now supports Internet access via HTTP/HTTPS and SOCKS proxy servers!
---

== Introduction

A good portion of Metanorma users work in security-sensitive environments (to no
one's surprise? :-) ) that have firewalls that block access to the Internet.

The only sanctioned manner to access the Internet in those environments is to
use an HTTPS or SOCKS proxy server provided by the organization.


== Proxied Internet access

The latest Metanorma release, v1.4.12, now supports using HTTP/HTTPS and SOCKS
proxy servers via the setting of environment variables.

We took inspiration from https://curl.se[cURL] in the manner of its
https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/proxies[proxy usage].

You can now use these environment variables to enable proxy access:

* `HTTPS_PROXY`: sets the endpoint of a HTTPS proxy
* `HTTP_PROXY`: sets the endpoint of a HTTP proxy (not recommended due to HTTP)
* `SOCKS_PROXY`: sets the endpoint of a SOCKS proxy

The general pattern of the proxy value is:

[source,sh]
----
{protocol}://{user}:{password}@{proxyhost}:{port}
----

Where:

* `:{port}` is optional
* `{user}@{password}` is optional
* the rest are mandatory

They can be used like this:

[source,console]
----
# Using the metanorma command directly with the proxy endpoint
HTTPS_PROXY=https://https-proxy.example.org metanorma site generate
#
# or if the environment variable is set separately
# e.g. export HTTPS_PROXY=https://https-proxy.example.org
metanorma site generate
----

And:

[source,console]
----
# Using the metanorma command directly with the proxy endpoint
env SOCKS_PROXY=socks5h://socks-proxy.example.org metanorma site generate
#
# or if the environment variable is set separately
# export SOCKS_PROXY=socks5h://socks-proxy.example.org
metanorma site generate
----

== Non-default proxy ports

Proxies on a non-default port are supported in this pattern:

[source,console]
----
HTTPS_PROXY=https://{proxyhost}:{port} metanorma site generate
----

e.g.

[source,console]
----
HTTPS_PROXY=https://https-proxy.example.org:32586 metanorma site generate
----

== Using authenticated proxies

Metanorma also supports authenticated proxies. The authentication information
needs to be supplied in the URL of the proxy.

Such as this.

[source,console]
----
HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:pass@https-proxy.example.org metanorma site generate
----

[source,console]
----
SOCKS_PROXY=socks5h://user:pass@socks-proxy.example.org metanorma site generate
----


== Proxying Git usage in Metanorma

Metanorma uses Git internally for fetching of templates and fonts, and the proxy
feature also applies to them.

In order to use Git functionality behind a proxy, you need to update your own
Git config via the `git config` command or the `~/.gitconfig` preference file.

There are many ways to configure your local Git install to use proxies.

The simplest, global way of setting a proxy for Git is the following.

* For HTTP
+
[source,sh]
----
git config --global http.proxy http://{user}:{pass}@{proxyhost}:{port}
----

* For HTTPS, you may need to handle SSL/TLS verification errors after setting
the proxy since the encryption end is located at your HTTPS proxy endpoint:
+
[source,sh]
----
git config --global http.proxy https://{user}:{pass}@{proxyhost}:{port}
git config --global https.proxy https://{user}:{pass}@{proxyhost}:{port}
----

* For SOCKS, you will need to decide on the SOCKS protocol
+
[source,sh]
----
git config --global http.proxy '{protocol}://{user}:{pass}@{proxyhost}:{port}'
git config --global https.proxy '{protocol}://{user}:{pass}@{proxyhost}:{port}'
----
+
For example,
+
[source,sh]
----
git config --global http.proxy 'socks5h://user:pass@socks-proxy.example.org'
git config --global https.proxy 'socks5h://user:pass@socks-proxy.example.org'
----

The list of supported SOCKS protocols for the `{protocol}` field:

* `socks://`: for SOCKS below v5
* `socks5://`: for SOCKS v5
* `socks5h://`: for SOCKS below v5 + host resolution via SOCKS

You could actually set different proxy behavior for individual Git repositories
