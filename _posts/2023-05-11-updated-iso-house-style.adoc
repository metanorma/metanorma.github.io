  Metanorma validation against the ISO House Style for ISO deliverables
  has been updated to the 2023 version of the style guide.
---

Metanorma-ISO validates ISO documents against the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Style],
issuing various warnings for wording and punctuation to ensure compliance
against that style guide.

Metanorma first implemented validation of the ISO House Style in 2022
(see link:/blog/2022-03-13-iso-house-style[Validating against ISO House Style]).

The implementation of ISO House Style validation has now been updated to the
2023 version of the style guide.

The following rules have been added:

* https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-need[Need to],
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-might[might & could]:
Warn of ambiguous provision wording.

* https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-quantity[Quantities and units]:
Warn of more than one level of nesting of subscripts.

* https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-r-ref_unnumbered[Cross-references to an unnumbered document]:
Superscript cross-references must follow punctuation.

Please feel free to contact the Metanorma team for additional (or modified)
validation rules if desired.
