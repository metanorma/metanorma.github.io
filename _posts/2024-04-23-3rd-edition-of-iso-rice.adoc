  ISO Rice document that has been used as a sample document to demonstrate the
  usage of Metanorma in ISO flavor has now been updated to the 3rd edition.
---

== Summary

The latest edition of the
https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100407.html[ISO Rice document] was published
in December 2023.

This post presents the changes introduced in the third English edition
and their implications to ISO authors, categorized into "normative changes"
vs "editorial changes".

A review of the differences compared to the second French edition,
the last French edition published, is also provided.


== Introduction

ISO Rice is a "document model" (an exemplar document) developed by the ISO
editorial team to demonstrate the elements and requirements for authors of
ISO standards.

The latest, 3rd edition, of the ISO Rice document was recently published
in December 2023 and it has been incorporated in the official set of
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-iso[Metanorma for ISO samples].

At Metanorma we use the ISO Rice for two purposes:

* as an exemplar for users for authoring ISO standards. The document helps
demonstrate the usage of Metanorma markup elements used for
link:/author/iso/[ISO].

* as an exemplar for Metanorma rendering of ISO documents, where most elements
allowed by
https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO DIR 2] are
demonstrated in this document.
+
NOTE: There are several allowed elements not demonstrated by ISO Rice, such as
repeating table headers and unit statements.

Traditionally, the ISO Rice document is published in both ISO official
languages: English and French. Somehow, the latest third Rice model is only
published in English.

At the Metanorma editorial team, we have done the following:

* In the Metanorma samples repository, we have updated the French version in a
best effort manner to a "3rd edition".

* We also provide an additional language, Chinese, as demonstration of CJK
encoding.


== History

The ISO Rice document was the brainchild of Joanna "Jo" Goodwin, back then the
Manager of Production Services at ISO, who moved on to serve as the
Terminology Coordinator for IEC.

Jo is also the author of https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5141.html[RFC 5141].


== Changes in the 3rd edition

=== General

The different types of changes encountered in the document are labelled.

For those familiar with ISO terminology, we distinguish:

* "normative changes" as changes that pertain to changes in practice of the ISO
document editor;

* "editorial changes" as those that are editorial in effect to the document,
with no behavioral changes that apply to an ISO document editor. These include
changes in content and formatting to the "ISO 17031-1" fictitious document.

* "Metanorma changes" as changes that require layout updates to Metanorma.

The clauses that are not described below have not been modified significantly in
the 3rd edition, i.e. the only modifications that have been done, if any, are
slight rewordings.

=== Metadata changes

Editorial changes:

* Like in every document that has been published in several editions, the
ISO Rice document has its document attributes updated.

** edition;
** date;
** reference number; and
** copyright year.

Metanorma change:

* For the publication date, instead of the full date format (`yyyy-mm-dd`) used
in the 2nd edition, the 3rd edition uses a condensed format that includes only
the year and month of publication (`yyyy-mm`). The user may continue using the
full date or the truncated date format.

==== Logo change

Metanorma change:

* The ISO logo has also been updated compared to the 2nd edition and is
shown in <<fig1>>.

=== Predefined text

==== Copyright statement

The copyright statement text remained mostly unchanged.

Normative change:

* It is worth noting that ISO started using the HTTPS protocol instead of
HTTP for the website URLs, which is entirely appropriate.
+
Therefore, clicking the `www.iso.org` link in the 3rd edition will direct a user
to `https://www.iso.org`, while clicking on the 2nd edition's URI will
attempt to reach `http://www.iso.org`, and redirect the user to the new link that
uses HTTPS.
+
The practice of using HTTPS over HTTP applies to all the URLs throughout the
document, so users should take note.

Metanorma change:

* There are rephrasing and changing positions of some contact elements.

* Specifically:

** the place of the publication has been moved from the top to the bottom;
** the address details have switched places in terms that the "CP 401" is
followed by "Ch. de Blandonnet 8";
** the country name has been removed from the address details.

* Fax details have also been removed, while the email address and the URI for the
website have been preceded by the appropriate keywords "Email" and "Website",
respectively, followed by a colon.

* Similarly, the keyword "Tel." before the phone number has been replaced with
"Phone:".

* A further specification (_"or required in the context of its implementation,"_)
has been added in the second sentence of the copyright statement.

* A comparison between the copyright statements in the second and the third
edition is shown in <<fig2>>.

==== Terms and definitions

Normative change:

* URLs have been changed to use HTTPS.

Metanorma change:

* The word _"terminological"_ used in the boilerplate is replaced by the word
_"terminology"_ in the 3rd edition.


=== Clauses

==== Foreword

Normative changes:

* The third paragraph of the Foreword clause, which includes details about the use
of patents, is now more detailed, as shown in <<fig3a>>.

* The fifth paragraph that refers to the
https://www.iso.org/foreword-supplementary-information.html[ISO Foreword] has
been updated (<<fig3b>>).

* These changes apply to all ISO documents, considering they are part of the
Foreword's template text.

* There is now a new paragraph that tells readers to report issues to national
standards bodies, as shown in <<fig4>>. This is new to the 3rd edition. This
change applies to all documents.


Editorial change:

* It is stated in the Foreword of the 3rd edition that the main changes in the
Rice document, compared to the 2nd edition, are the updating of normative
references and revision of Clause 9.

==== Introduction

Editorial changes:

* Only the first three paragraphs have been retained while omitting the rest of
the text from the 2nd edition.

* Additionally, estimation of the "storage losses" has been updated through the
ISO 17301-1:2023/Amd 1:2023 (Amendment 1).


==== Normative references

Editorial changes:

* As mentioned in the Foreword clause of ISO 17301-1:2023, one of the major
differences from the 2nd edition is updating of normative references.
Specifically, ISO 16634 was under preparation, in the DIS stage, when the 2nd
edition was published. The third edition uses ISO 16634-2:2016 as the normative
reference.

* Amendment 1 updates the reference used in Clause 8, and therefore updates the
undated reference that has been used initially with its published date as well.


==== Terms and definitions

Editorial changes:

* Considering the bibliography and normative references have been updated in the third
edition, cross-references and `source` attributes have been updated accordingly.
Taking into account that the `source` should be a dated reference to provide a clause
number, the `source` used for defining the term _husked rice yield_ (3.10) is cited
as a dated reference, although it has been listed as an undated reference in the
Normative references clause.
// Besides from the publishing date, modifications for ISO 7301:2011, 3.2 have also been slightly reworded.

* Moreover, the term "husked rice" has been given an alternative name "brown rice".

* This clause has also been slightly modified in terms of rephrasing, adding missing
cross-references to other terms specified in the clause, and adding modifications to
the referenced sources. Subclause 4.2.1 has been added a new note, and one of the values
from Table 1 has been updated.
// "mechanical milling" instead of "milling"; "Parboiled rice" cross-referenced; "either unripe or underdeveloped, or both" instead of "unripe and/or underdeveloped"; added hyperlink to Figure C.1; added modified part in "[SOURCE: ISO 14864:1998, 3.1, modified — Note 1 to entry added.]" and in "[SOURCE: ISO 14864:1998, 3.3, modified — admitted term, t90, added to the term entry.]"

==== Specifications

Normative changes:

* The 3rd edition demonstrates the usage of the
link:/author/topics/blocks/tables/#key[Key section] in the table
environment, replacing "Not applicable" with "N/A" and providing the acronym
explanation as part of the Key section in the table footer.
Users should take note.

Editorial changes:

* The second paragraph has been replaced with a note in the Specifications
clause, as shown in <<fig5>>.
* Similar modifications as in the Terms and definitions have been applied to the
Specifications clause.


[[fig5]]

image::/assets/blog/2024-04-23/specifications-01.png[]

Metanorma change:

* After further consultations with the ISO editorial team, it is confirmed that
the preferable order of the elements in the table footer is as follows:

.. text;
.. note;
.. footnote;
.. key.

* Moreover, the Key section should be preceded by the boldfaced "Key" title.
//this is currently not the case in the 3rd edition

// added "moisture, determined in accordance with ISO 712," in 4.2.1; hyperlinked Table 1; footnote 2) not used
// hyperlinks added in 6.4, A.4.2, Annex C as well


==== Test methods

This clause demonstrates the usage of an
link:/author/topics/blocks/admonitions/[admonition] in its subclause 6.5.1
Determination.

Editorial changes:

* While the 2nd edition used a caution message, the third one has modified this
message to a warning.

* Additionally, the subclause 6.5.2.1 Interlaboratory test has been appended further
information shown in <<fig6>>.

* It is also worth noting that in subclause 6.3, ISO 20483 is cross-referenced as an
undated reference, although it has been listed as a dated reference in the Normative
references clause.

* Similar to the previous clauses, several definitions of this one have been rewritten
to omit redundancy or to provide a further specification.
// repeatability; reproducibility

==== Test report

Editorial change:

* The 3rd edition omits item _"g) any deviations from the procedure"_ from the
list of the specifications that shall be provided for each test method in the
test report.

==== Packaging
//8 Packaging > shall comply vs. shall be in accordance

Normative changes:

* When a new annex is added to a document, ISO refers to that annex in the body
of the document. This has been demonstrated by adding a paragraph that
references to the new Annex E at the end of this clause in Amendment 1.
+
NOTE: This is already required editorial practice, but it is good to see the ISO
Rice being updated to reflect this.

* Amendment 1 also replaces cross-references to ISO 8351-1 and ISO 8351-2 with
more specific, dated references and updated clause numbers.

NOTE: This reflects latest ISO editorial practice that dated references are
required when cross-referencing to clauses.


==== Marking and labelling

Editorial changes:

* Clause name "Marking" has been appended with "and labelling" in the 3rd
edition. This clause has also been updated to provide more information, as shown
in <<fig7>>.

* Subsequently, it has been specified by Amendment 1 that the first sentence
needs to be replaced to point out that the marking and labelling on the
packaging shall clearly identify the type of rice.

==== Annex A

Normative changes:

* Figure A.1 illustrated a patented item, which shall be avoided. This change
indicates that patented items are to be further considered by the committee
in publication.

Editorial changes:

* Amendment 1 provides two replacement figures with the appropriate description.

==== Annex B

Normative changes:

* Considering the use of trade names should be avoided, the trade name "Lugols"
has been removed from subclause B.3.2, along with the corresponding footnote,
which was present in the 2nd edition to provide further information about
"Lugols".
+
This change demonstrates to the ISO author the preference to remove
existing trade names from content and discursive content such as footnotes.

Editorial changes:

* Having omitted this footnote, along with the footnote from the Normative
references section that was used to inform the readers that the ISO 16634 is
under preparation, and another one from the subclause 4.2.1, the 3rd edition of
the ISO Rice document no longer involves footnotes.

//A.3 Sampling rewording
//B.3 Reagents rewording
//B.3.3 Iodine working solution rewording

==== Annex C

Normative changes:

* Annex C demonstrates the updates made in the 3rd edition in terms of adding
hyperlinks to some internal document elements, i.e. cross-referencing figures in this
specific case.

* It can also be noticed from <<fig8>> that a further specification has been
provided for Figure C.2, while the Key section for Figure C.1 has been updated
to list the symbol used on the horizontal axis first, and then the symbol on the
vertical axis.

==== Annex E

Normative change:

* An additional Annex, named "Recommendations relating to storage and transport
conditions", has been added through the Amendment 1. Its content is shown in
<<fig9>>. This demonstrates how to add an additional Annex through an Amendment.

==== Bibliography

Normative changes:

* The references have been updated to be in accordance with the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Style].

* Specifically, the ampersand character (`&`) has been replaced with the word
"and" where applicable, and the italicization of the publication elements has
been applied accordingly.

Editorial changes:

* The 3rd edition of the document refers to the newer editions of the literature
listed in the Bibliography clause of the 2nd edition.

* The reference to IEC 61010-2 is removed.


== English vs. French editions

=== Background

The 2nd edition of the ISO Rice document in French has been provided by ISO
directly.

Since ISO did not publish a 3rd French edition, the Metanorma team has
translated the differences found between the 2nd and the 3rd English editions,
and applied the corresponding changes to the "3rd" French edition.

=== Noteworthy mention

The 2nd edition in French uses "modified" additions to the sources for terms
3.11 and 3.12, which are not present in English editions (neither second nor
third). These additions are kept in the 3rd edition of the document in French.

This behavior demonstrates to the ISO author that multilingual ISO documents are
allowed to have different terminology sources and behavior. This is likely an
advanced topic for another blog post.

NOTE: If you're interested in this topic, ping us!

=== Editorial changes

During this process, it was noticed that the wording was initially different in some
parts of the text between the second French and English editions:

* For example, "grain ou partie de grain" (translates to "kernel or part of
kernel") has been used in French, while "kernel, whole or broken" has been used
in English.

It is worth noting that parts like this have not been altered when the French
edition was updated, but rather only the analogous changes found between the two
editions in English were applied to the 3rd edition of the document in French.

In other words, after applying changes with this approach, the initial
differences in wording remained unchanged, as demonstrated by <<example>>.

== Conclusion

The important normative change for the ISO document author is:

* The preference of dated references when cross-references are used is made
clear.

* Practices regarding patents and trade names need to be adhered to.

* From a style perspective, the ISO editorial team has described the layout of
the table footer's Key section.

The rest are editorial changes.

In summary:

* Metanorma has been updated to handle all the latest editorial
practices and requirements demonstrated in the 3rd edition of the ISO Rice
document.

* The mn-samples-iso repository has been updated to showcase both the 2016/2017
ISO Rice documents, and the latest 2023/2024 ISO Rice documents, demonstrating
the application of Metanorma towards ISO documents.
