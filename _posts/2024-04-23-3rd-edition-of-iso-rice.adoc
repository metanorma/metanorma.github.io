  ISO Rice document that has been used as a sample document to demonstrate the
  usage of Metanorma in ISO flavor has now been updated to the third edition.
---

== Introduction

ISO Rice is a document that is used by https://www.metanorma.org/[Metanorma] to
demonstrate the usage of different markup elements in
https://www.metanorma.org/author/iso/[ISO flavour]. Up to this date, it has been
published in three languages: English, French, and Chinese.

In this blog post, we will present novelties introduced in the third English edition
issued in 2023, along with a review of the third edition in French.

== Novelties in the third ISO Rice edition

Like in every document that has been published in several editions, ISO Rice modifies
its document attributes accordingly by updating the edition, date, reference number,
and copyright year throughout the document. Instead of the previously used full date
format (`yyyy-mm-dd`), the third edition uses a condensed format that includes only
the year and month of publication (`yyyy-mm`). Moreover, the ISO logo has been
updated compared to the second edition and is shown in <<fig1>>.

In the following sections, the differences between the second and the third edition
will be explained further, starting from the predefined text
(https://www.metanorma.org/develop/topics/metadata-and-boilerplate/[boilerplate])
updates, through the differences in the content and formatting throughout the
clauses. The clauses that are not listed below have not been modified significantly
in the third edition, i.e. the only modifications that have been done, if any, are
slight rewordings.

=== Predefined text

==== Copyright Statement

Even though the copyright statement's text remained mostly unchanged, rephrasing and
changing positions of some contact elements have been done.

Specifically, the place of the publication has been moved from the top to the bottom,
and the address details have switched places in terms that the "CP 401" is followed
by "Ch. de Blandonnet 8". The country name has been removed from the address details.

Fax details have also been removed, while the email address and the URI for the
website have been preceded by the appropriate keywords "Email" and "Website",
respectively, followed by a colon. Similarly, the keyword "Tel." before the phone
number has been replaced with "Phone:".

A further specification (_"or required in the context of its implementation,"_) has
been added in the second sentence of the copyright statement.

A comparison between the copyright statements in the second and the third edition is
shown in <<fig2>>.

It is also worth noting that ISO started using HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP for the
website URIs. Therefore, clicking the www.iso.org URI in the third edition will
direct a user to the https://www.iso.org website, while clicking on the second
edition's URI will attempt to reach http://www.iso.org, and redirect the user to the
new link that uses HTTPS. This applies to all the URIs throughout the document.

==== Terms and definitions

Besides changing the URIs to use HTTPS protocol, the word _"terminological"_ used in
the boilerplate is replaced by the word _"terminology"_ in the third edition.

=== Document clauses

==== Foreword

ISO states in the foreword of the third edition that the main changes in comparison
to the second edition are the updating of normative references and revision of Clause 9.

The third paragraph of the Foreword clause, which includes details about the use of
patents, has been more specified, as shown in <<fig3a>>. Similar applies to the fifth
paragraph that refers to the information given in the
https://www.iso.org/foreword-supplementary-information.html[ISO's foreword] on their
official website (<<fig3b>>). These changes apply to all committees, considering they
are part of the Foreword's template text for all of them.

Lastly, the third edition adds information about the national standards body, as
shown in <<fig4>>. This change is committee-specific and therefore does not apply to
all committees.

==== Introduction

Only the first three paragraphs have been retained while omitting the rest of the
text from the second edition.

Additionally, estimation of the storage losses has been updated through the
ISO 17301-1:2023/Amd.1:2023 (Amendment 1).

==== Normative references

As mentioned in the Foreword clause of ISO 17301-1:2023, one of the major differences
from the second edition is updating of normative references. Specifically, ISO 16634
was under preparation, in the DIS stage, when the second edition was published. The third
edition uses ISO 16634-2:2016 as the normative reference.

Amendment 1 updates the reference used in Clause 8, and therefore updates the undated
reference that has been used initially with its published date as well.

==== Terms and definitions

Considering the bibliography and normative references have been updated in the third
edition, cross-references and `source` attributes have been updated accordingly.
Taking into account that the `source` should be a dated reference to provide a clause
number, the `source` used for defining the term _husked rice yield_ (3.10) is cited
as a dated reference, although it has been listed as an undated reference in the
Normative references clause.
// Besides from the publishing date, modifications for ISO 7301:2011, 3.2 have also been slightly reworded.
Moreover, the term "husked rice" has been given an alternative name "brown rice".

This clause has also been slightly modified in terms of rephrasing, adding missing
cross-references to other terms specified in the clause, and adding modifications to
the referenced sources. Subclause 4.2.1 has been added a new note, and one of the values
from Table 1 has been updated.
// "mechanical milling" instead of "milling"; "Parboiled rice" cross-referenced; "either unripe or underdeveloped, or both" instead of "unripe and/or underdeveloped"; added hyperlink to Figure C.1; added modified part in "[SOURCE: ISO 14864:1998, 3.1, modified — Note 1 to entry added.]" and in "[SOURCE: ISO 14864:1998, 3.3, modified — admitted term, t90, added to the term entry.]"

==== Specifications

The second paragraph has been replaced with a note in the Specifications clause, as
shown in <<fig5>>.

[[fig5]]

Similar modifications as in the Terms and definitions have been applied to the
Specifications clause. Furthermore, the third edition demonstrates the usage of the
https://www.metanorma.org/author/topics/blocks/tables/#key[Key section] in the table
environment, replacing "Not applicable" with "N/A" and providing the acronym
explanation as part of the Key section in the table footer.

After further consultations with ISO, it has been confirmed that the preferable order
of the elements in the table footer is as follows:

. text;
. note;
. footnote;
. key.

Moreover, the Key section should be preceded by the boldfaced "Key" title.
//this is currently not the case in the third edition

// added "moisture, determined in accordance with ISO 712," in 4.2.1; hyperlinked Table 1; footnote 2) not used
// hyperlinks added in 6.4, A.4.2, Annex C as well

==== Test methods

This clause demonstrates the usage of an
https://www.metanorma.org/author/topics/blocks/admonitions/[admonition] in its
subclause 6.5.1 Determination. While the second edition used a caution message, the
third one has modified this message to a warning.

Additionally, the subclause 6.5.2.1 Interlaboratory test has been appended further
information shown in <<fig6>>.

[[fig6]]

image::/assets/blog/2024-04-23_interlab.png[]

It is also worth noting that in subclause 6.3, ISO 20483 is cross-referenced as an
undated reference, although it has been listed as a dated reference in the Normative
references clause.

Similar to the previous clauses, several definitions of this one have been rewritten
to omit redundancy or to provide a further specification.
// repeatability; reproducibility

==== Test report

The third edition omits item _"g) any deviations from the procedure"_ from the list
of the specifications that shall be provided for each test method in the test report.

==== Packaging
//8 Packaging > shall comply vs. shall be in accordance

When a new annex is added to a document, ISO refers to that annex in the
body of the document. This has been demonstrated by adding a paragraph that references
to the new Annex E at the end of this clause in Amendment 1.

Amendment 1 also replaces cross-references to ISO 8351-1 and ISO 8351-2 with more
specific, dated references and updated clause numbers.

==== Marking and labelling

Clause name "Marking" has been appended with "and labelling" in the third edition.
This clause has also been updated to provide more information, as shown in <<fig7>>.

[[fig7]]

Subsequently, it has been specified by Amendment 1 that the first sentence needs to
be replaced to point out that the marking and labelling on the packaging shall
clearly identify the type of rice.

==== Annex A

Figure A.1 illustrated a patented item, which shall be avoided. Amendment 1 provides
two replacement figures with the appropriate description.

==== Annex B

Considering the use of trade names should be avoided, the trade name Lugols has been
removed from subclause B.3.2, along with the corresponding footnote, which was
present in the second edition to provide further information about Lugols. Having
omitted this footnote, along with the footnote from the Normative references section
that was used to inform the readers that the ISO 16634 is under preparation, and
another one from the subclause 4.2.1, the third edition of the ISO Rice document no
longer involves footnotes.

//A.3 Sampling rewording
//B.3 Reagents rewording
//B.3.3 Iodine working solution rewording

==== Annex C

Annex C demonstrates the updates made in the third edition in terms of adding
hyperlinks to some internal document elements, i.e. cross-referencing figures in this
specific case. It can also be noticed from <<fig8>> that a further specification has
been provided for Figure C.2, while the Key section for Figure C.1 has been updated
to list the symbol used on the horizontal axis first, and then the symbol on the
vertical axis.

==== Annex E

Additional annex, named "Recommendations relating to storage and transport conditions",
has been added through the Amendment 1. Its content is shown in <<fig9>>.

==== Bibliography

The third edition of the document refers to the newer editions of the literature
listed in the Bibliography clause of the second edition. Furthermore, it removes
reference to IEC 61010-2 and updates the references in accordance with the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Style]. Specifically, ampersand
(&) has been replaced with the word "and" where applicable, and the italicization of
the publication elements has been applied accordingly.

=== English vs. French editions

The second edition of the ISO Rice document in French has been provided by ISO
directly, while the third edition has been produced by the Metanorma team by
translating the differences found between the second and the third English editions
and applying the corresponding changes to the third French edition accordingly.

During this process, it was noticed that the wording was initially different in some
parts of the text between the second French and English editions. For example, "grain
ou partie de grain" (translates to "kernel or part of kernel") has been used in
French, while "kernel, whole or broken" has been used in English. It is worth noting
that parts like this have not been altered when the French edition was updated, but
rather only the analogous changes found between the two editions in English were
applied to the third edition of the document in French. In other words, after
applying changes with this approach, the initial differences in wording remained
unchanged, as demonstrated by <<example>>.

Besides the aforementioned differences, the second edition in French uses "modified"
additions to the sources for terms 3.11 and 3.12, which are not present in English
editions (neither second nor third). These additions are kept in the third edition of
the document in French.

== Conclusion

As stated by ISO, the major updates in the third edition of the ISO Rice document are
in the normative references and Clause 9. From a style perspective, the important
update is defining how the Key section should be represented in the table footer.

Except from omitting all the footnotes from the second edition, the rest of the
elements that demonstrate the application of Metanorma features to the ISO documents
remained unchanged.
