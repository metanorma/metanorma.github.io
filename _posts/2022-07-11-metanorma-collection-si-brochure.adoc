excerpt: >-
  Metanorma now supports Metanorma collections, a feature that allows
  a set of Metanorma documents to be published in flexible configurations.
---
== Summary

The Metanorma collection functionality is a new feature used by complex
standards published using Metanorma.

In this blog post we will use the
https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure[SI Brochure], published by the
https://www.bipm.org[BIPM], as an example of how it is used.

This post will illustrate how to compile the BIPM SI Brochure using the
`collection` sub-command.


== What's in a Collection?

Standards are typically published as individual documents. However, there are
standards that are a lot more complex:

* the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303[ISO 10303] series of standards is
published as a collection known as the
https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100443.html[STEP Module and Resource Library (SMRL)],
with interlinking links and embedded computer-readable
https://www.expresslang.org/language/[EXPRESS] models;

* the BIPM SI Brochure is composed of multiple documents, including
the main content, CGPM and CIPM outcomes in both French and English, all cross-linked,
together with over 20
https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/mises-en-pratique[mise en pratique]
documents, where each of these components can be individually published.


== The SI Brochure

The https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure[SI Brochure] is the
authoritative document detailing the now ubiquitous
https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units[International System of Units (SI)]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units[Wikipedia]),
commonly called the "SI system".

The SI system is established and maintained by the
https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cg/cgpm[General Conference on Weights and Measures / Conférence générale des poids et mesures (CGPM)],
which was established by the
https://www.bipm.org/en/metre-convention[Metre Convention]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention[Wikipedia]) of 1875.

The SI Brochure is offered under the Creative Commons 3 license.

The Metanorma team has been tasked by BIPM to develop a machine-readable form of
the BIPM SI Brochure, of which the workings is worthy of several blog posts.

In this blog post, we use the BIPM SI Brochure to illustrate how to compile a
Metanorma collection.


== SI Brochure in Metanorma

The SI Brochure is structured as a Metanorma collection.

Specifically, it is published in 3 forms:

* A French-English bilingual version
* A French version
* An English version

In Metanorma, the French and English versions are independent documents.
The bilingual version, on the other hand, is a composite document that is
directly composed of the combination of the French and English documents.

Can't we just "concatenate the two documents and slap on a new cover page"?

It is actually a lot more complex than this:

* The French and English versions contain cross-references to each other. In the
bilingual composite version, these links become internal links, and the
corresponding references in the bibliography are also considered internal within
the collection (since both parts are given in the same document)

* The metadata of the individual documents and the metadata of the bilingual
collection differ but both need to be reflected.

* The document elements shared between the French and English documents, such as
figures, resolution outcomes and bibliographic references, should not be
duplicated in the bilingual collection.

* The bilingual collection allows the generation (or extraction) of its source
components, namely, the French and English documents in their desired form and
respective cover pages.

Ultimately, this structure allows us to retain only a single source of truth
without duplication while keeping the document components independent.


== Compiling the collection

As mentioned, the SI Brochure is offered under the Creative Commons 3 license
so there should not be licensing concerns in performing this exercise.

The draft version of the machine-readable SI Brochure is available at:

* https://github.com/metanorma/bipm-si-brochure

Once you have link:/install[installed Metanorma], you are ready to do the actual
compilation of the document.

Clone the repository with your favorite Git application. We recommend either
using the `git` command or https://desktop.github.com[GitHub Desktop].

In macOS or Linux, you could do:

[source,sh]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/metanorma/bipm-si-brochure
----

Generate the source Metanorma documents into `site/documents`:

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma site generate -c brochure.yml --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: The `-c brochure.yml` flag is used to only generate necessary files for
the bilingual SI Brochure; it does not compile any MEP documents.

Once it is finished you will be able to see compilation results under
`site/documents`.

NOTE: This is the default directory but you can change the target directory
with the `--output-dir` argument.

Then generate the bilingual collection documents with:

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma collection collection.yml -w collection -x xml,html,presentation,pdf \
  -c sources/collection_cover.html --agree-to-terms --no-continue-without-fonts
----

NOTE: This step may take some time depending on processor speed.

The resulting document will be generated in the directory `collection`.
You should see these files generated:

* Bilingual SI Brochure (PDF): `collection.pdf`

* Language-specific SI Brochure (PDF)
** English SI Brochure `collection_en.pdf`
** French SI Brochure `collection_fr.pdf`

* Metanorma XML files
** Metanorma Semantic XML `collection.xml`
** Metanorma Presentational XML `collection.presentation.xml`

The machine-readable versions of the SI Brochure are in the XML files.
The semantic version provides full semantic encoding of content, where the
presentational version provides rendering-oriented structured content.

If you are curious of the inner workings of the Metanorma collection,
have a look at `collection.yml` which provides instructions to Metanorma on how
to process the input files.

== Conclusion

Metanorma provides a flexible collection compilation functionality for
standards. The bilingual SI Brochure can be technically generated just with
one line of command (or two!).

We will likely follow up with more articles on how a collection works.
Stay tuned!
