  Metanorma XML to PDF supports a new ITU cover page layout for 
  Technical and Service publications (Flagship).
---

Metanorma-ITU now produces the PDF with a new cover page layout for:

* Technical publications

* Service publications (Flagship)

By default, the Metanorma generates the PDF in the new layout now. You can 
switch to the previous (old) layout by setting the document attribute
`:document-scheme: legacy`.

The new ITU cover page contains a few new elements. New document attributes 
added into the Metanorma to support them:

`:collection-title:`:: the collection of documents that this document 
appears in. Appears on the top left of the cover page.

`:sector:`:: the standardization sector for the document, if one of 
the defined bureaus does not apply ('Telecommunication Standardization Bureau', 
'Radiocommunication Bureau' or 'Telecommunication Development Bureau'
which automatically determined by the document attribute `:bureau:`).

Flagship publications require a few additional document attributes:

`:coverpage-image:`:: comma-delimited list of image locations, for images to be 
included on the PDF cover page of ITU "Service Publications" (and title page 
for logos). All image locations are relative to the source document. 
Cover page should contain also event, partner and copublisher logos (if exists), 
except the ITU logo at right bottom corner. We recommend to use the one-paged 
PDF for cover page image. If there isn't enough space on the cover to include 
all the logos, then specify the second image location to render it on inner 
cover page in the result PDF.

`:presentation-metadata-color-cover-title:`:: title colour on PDF cover, as 'black' 
(default) or 'white', depending on the contrast with the background.

`:presentation-metadata-cover-header-hide:`:: hide page header titles (ITUPublications, 
International Telecommunication Union, Sector or Bureau name). The values are 'true' or 
'false' (default). Some Flagship publications doesn't require the cover header.

`:presentation-metadata-color-cover-itu-logo:`:: ITU logo color - '#1DA0DB' (default) or 
'white'. Allows to choose the color to contrast with background.

`:slogan-title:`:: the slogan that this document is branded with, in connection with 
an event. Some Flagship publications allows the slogan title. Regarding the ITU 
official style guide, these fonst should be used for slogan title:

* "Adelle italic" for latin and cyrillic scripts

* "Traditional arabic" for Arabic

* "STKaiti" for Chinese

Fontist currently does not support (can't be installed) any of these fonts, 
but they are provided on Windows, Office and Mac:

* "Adelle Devanagari" is available on the macOS (can be substituted instead of "Adelle italic")

* "Traditional Arabic" is provided on Windows and Office.

* "STKaiti" is only provided by Office.

Fontist may find these fonts on the user machine and pass them into the PDF 
production tool (mn2pdf) via the font manifest file.

As existence of the slogan title currently is rare case, then the font
should be specified manually in the document attributes (vs. specified in metanorma-itu gem 
for mainly using fonts), so the user responsible for pre-installation of these fonts.

For example, `:fonts: Traditional Arabic` (see `:fonts:` description in 
https://www.metanorma.org/author/ref/document-attributes/#visual-appearance)
