  Metanorma now supports encoding of ruby characters, often used in
  documents in East Asian languages.

== Introduction

Metanorma supports the authoring of
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-jis[Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS)].

In order to consolidate its support of East Asian languages such as Japanese,
Metanorma has started supporting Ruby annotation of text.

== Ruby characters

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character[Ruby characters] are small
annotations that appear alongside characters in East Asian languages.
They are primarily used to indicate the pronunciation of characters,
and are particularly common in that function in Japanese, where they are
referred to as _furigana_:

Because annotations are meant to explain characters, they are not themselves
expected to be ideographic characters, and are instead given in syllabaries or
alphabets associated with phonetic guides, such as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana[Hiragana],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana[Katakana], or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese[Romaji (Latin script)]
in Japanese, and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin[Pinyin] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo[Bopomofo] in Chinese.

== Ruby representing semantic information or pronouncing instructions

It is possible to annotate characters with text indicating the meaning instead
of, or as well as, the pronunciation of the character.

.Example of semantic annotation in Ruby: 親友 _shin'yū_ "close friend" annotated with the English loanword ライバル _raibaru_ "rival", to mean "a rival who is also friend" (cf. English _frenemy_)
[example]

== Double-sided ruby annotations

It is possible for double-sided annotations to have different scope. In the
example above, _mamo_ annotates only the Kanji 護, while _protego_ annotates the
full word 護れ.

And annotations can be double-sided, with an annotation either side of the
characters being annotated:

.Example of "double-sided" Ruby, 護れ _mamore_ "protect" annotated phonetically in two languages: マモ _mamo_ in Japanese, and プロテゴ _protego_ in English
[example]

In the following example, each character is phonetically glossed: 東 as とう
_tō_, 南 as なん _nan_, But the entire name is glossed as たつみ _tatsumi_:
_tōnan_ is the expect Japanese pronunciation of 東南 "southeast", but _tatsumi_
is an archaic Japanese word for "southeast", and therefore a legitimate reading
of the same two characters.

.tō + nan = tatsumi no hōgaku: "in the direction of the southeast"

== Digital support for ruby characters

Ruby support has proven quite challenging in digital typography:

* *HTML*

** The initial https://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/[W3C specification on HTML support of
Ruby] (2001) has proven very complex to implement.

** Even the https://www.w3.org/International/articles/ruby/markup[HTML5
approach] (2016) has not been taken up by browsers.

** The contemporary approach taken in the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby[Living HTML specification]
is drastically simpler; see
https://strictquirks.nl/standards/the-situation-with-ruby-2020.xhtml[The situation with `<ruby>`] (2020)
for details on the challenges encountered.

* *CSS* has received a much greater role in
https://www.w3.org/International/articles/ruby/styling.en[CSS support of Ruby]
than was originally envisioned.
Browser support of Ruby styling remains uneven as of this writing
(e.g. for https://caniuse.com/?search=ruby-position[`ruby-position`]).

* *Microsoft Word* does not natively support double-sided Ruby annotations: they
presuppose only one annotation per set of characters.

* *PDF* generation tools, such as Apache FOP and XSL-FO, do not natively
support Ruby at all.


== Metanorma implementation of ruby characters

=== Requirements

Metanorma requirements on the implementation of ruby characters are as follows:

* provide a model for encoding ruby characters that is not tethered to an obsolete or overly complicated encoding model;
* enables semantic treatment and processing of annotations;
* allows a reasonable range of rendering options.

In terms of feature support, specifically:

* supports distinction between semantic and phonetic annotations
* supports identification of script and language of annotation
* supports double-sided ruby characters
* supports partly-overlapping annotations

While edge cases will require full annotation markup and bookmarks to succeed,
the model we have arrived at provides reasonable coverage of any ruby characters
likely to arise in standards documents such as Japanese Industrial Standards.

=== Encoding syntax

In the simplest case, Ruby annotations are marked up as:

.Syntax for encoding ruby characters
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:{annotation}[{annotated character(s)}]
----


=== Simple ruby characters

The following are how the phonetic guides to "Tokyo" above would be marked up:

.Example of encoding simple ruby characters
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:とうきょう[東京]
ruby:トウキョウ[東京]
ruby:Tōkyō[東京]
----
====

=== Per character ruby

Annotations can be broken down per character:

.Example of encoding ruby character annotations broken down character levels
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:とう[東]ruby:きょう[京]
ruby:トウ[東]ruby:キョウ[京]
ruby:Tō[東]ruby:kyō[京]
----
====

=== Double-sided ruby characters

Double-sided ruby is supported, with `ruby:[]` macro nesting. This approach is
consistent with HTML 5, and is the only approach supported in Living HTML.

In any nesting of AsciiDoc macros, the closing bracket of the nested macro
instance needs to be escaped.

The syntax for double-sided ruby is therefore:

.Syntax for double-sided ruby
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:[ ... ruby:[...\] ... ]
----

Metanorma assumes that in double-sided ruby, the outer annotation appears before
the characters annotated, and the inner annotation appears after them.

NOTE: In Word, where double-sided Ruby is not supported, the inner annotation
appears after the characters in brackets, as a workaround.

.Encoding double-sided ruby from above examples
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:プロテゴ[ruby:まも[護\]{blank}れ]!
ruby:たつみ[ruby:とう[東\]ruby:なん[南\]]
----

=== Encoding additional information to the ruby characters

Additional information can be provided optionally for the ruby characters.

* *script code*: The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924[ISO 15924] code
can be entered with the prefix `script=`.
+
.Example of encoding ruby characters with script code
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:とうきょう[script=Hira,東京]
----
====

* *language code*: The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639[ISO 639] code
is entered with the prefix `lang=`.
+
[example]
.Example of encoding ruby characters with language code
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:Tōkyō[lang=ja,script=Latn,東京]
ruby:トウキョウ[script=Kana,lang=ja,東京]
----
====

* *type of ruby*: Either `pronunciation` (default) or `annotation`.
+
[example]
.Example of encoding ruby characters indicated as `annotation`
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:しんゆ[親友]　// by default type `pronunciation`
ruby:しんゆ[type=pronunciation,親友]
ruby:ライバル[type=annotation,親友]
----
====


== Conclusion

Metanorma now supports encoding of ruby characters with a mature implementation,
and this functionality is now available across all Metanorma flavors.
