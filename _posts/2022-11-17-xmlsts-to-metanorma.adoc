  Metanorma now supports converting ISO STS and NISO STS XML formats
  into Metanorma formats through its `mnconvert` tool.
---

== Introduction

Imagine that you have a typically long XML file compliant with ISO STS or NISO
STS, which you want to shift to other file formats, such as `.html`, `.doc` and
`.pdf`.

The file needs to be first encoded as Metanorma AsciiDoc content, but this can
be a really tedious task even with the most advanced text editor at your
disposal.

Metanorma now provides a new tool, _mnconvert_, which enables such conversion.


== ISO STS and NISO STS

Both ISO STS and NISO STS allude to the definition of elements and attributes
(i.e., tag sets) to describe, in a semantic and structured manner,
the metadata and the full content of standard documents in XML.

ISO STS is an ISO internal XML format that was tailored from
https://jats.niso.org/jatswiki/index.php/Main_Page[JATS], used for encoding
and PDF-printing ISO standards.

NISO STS, is meant to be the superset of ISO STS. A number of ISO members, the national standards bodies,
wanted to adopt ISO STS for national standards publishing. They took ISO STS to
NISO, and created NISO STS, which is a more generic tag set than ISO STS.
It also supports notions of national and regional adoption of standards, so it
is more extensive than ISO STS.

For more in-depth information about ISO STS, visit
https://www.iso.org/schema/isosts/v1.1/doc/index.html[ISO Standards Tag Set documentation].

For more in-depth information about NISO STS, visit
https://www.niso-sts.org/TagLibrary/niso-sts-TL-1-2-html/index.html[NISO STS documentation].


== What is _mnconvert_?

link:https://github.com/metanorma/mnconvert[_mnconvert_] is a
tool that transfers the content of an XML
document compliant with ISO/NISO STS to Metanorma AsciiDoc. It was
developed with the intent of speeding up the conversion process.

_mnconvert_ is a Java program packed into a JAR file that you will
need to reference in your command execution.

Quick guidance on requirements for tool installation and usage is given
below. For more information, please refer to
https://github.com/metanorma/mnconvert#readme[_mnconvert_
documentation].


=== Requirements

To use _mnconvert_, you need to meet the following criteria:

* Have Java JDK installed in your system. You can download
an installer at: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows.
(If you think you have Java JDK already but are not sure, just execute
`java -version` to confirm.);

* Have the latest JAR release of _mnconvert_ available for download
at: https://github.com/metanorma/_mnconvert_/releases;

* Have `make` and `maven` build tools installed as per instructions in
https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac;

* Have an XML file compliant with ISO/NISO STS (i.e., XML STS).

=== Usage

The command structure of _mnconvert_ is:

[source,console]
--
java -jar <JAR_path\JAR_filename>.jar <XML_path\XML_filename>.xml [options]
--

For illustrative purposes, let's assume that:

* the JAR and XML files are located in the same folder,
* we are using JAR release 1.27.0, i.e. `mnconvert-1.27.0.jar`,
* the XML STS file we want to convert is named `standard.xml`.

Taking these assumptions into account, the command simplifies to:

[source,console]
--
java -jar mnconvert-1.27.0.jar standard.xml [options]
--

If we don't specify any optional parameters (listed in the section below),
the default
behavior of the program is to convert the given XML file to Metanorma AsciiDoc,
placing the converted files in the same location as the XML file. The filename of
the main document will be kept the same as in the provided XML file, but with
`.adoc` extension. Sections and images (if any) will be placed in separate
subfolders, named `sections` and `images`, respectively, as in the commonly
used structure of our document
https://github.com/metanorma/iso-27002/tree/main/sources[samples].

=== Optional parameters for conversion

While _mnconvert_ tool can be used without any additional options,
you might find them useful for adaptation of the conversion results.

Some of the available options are:

`--output` or `-o`::  to specify an output path different to the XML
file.

`--output-format` or `-of`:: to specify the output format, `xml` or
`adoc`, being `adoc` the default value.

`--imagesdir` or `-img`:: to specify an `:imagesdir:` attribute value.
Default is "images".

`--mathml` or `-m`:: to specify the MathML version of the XML STS.
`2` for MathML version 2, or `3` for MathML version 3.

`--check-type` or `-ct`:: to perform a validation check of the XML
file against ISO/NISO STS. Values are: `xsd-niso` (check against NISO
XSD), `dtd-niso` (check against NISO DTD), and `iso-dtd` (check against
ISO DTD).

Full list of options is available in
https://github.com/metanorma/mnconvert#readme[_mnconvert_
documentation].

== Converting ISO/NISO STS to Metanorma AsciiDoc

Once the initial conversion with _mnconvert_ tool is done as described in
the previous sections, it is quite likely that some
adjustments will need to be made to get a properly encoded Metanorma AsciiDoc.
In other words, we need to validate that the Metanorma encoding rules
are correctly applied.
link:/author/topics/document-format/[Metanorma documentation]
will be our best ally in this chore. This should be a quick validation
though, given that the _mnconvert_ tool does the majority of the work.
However, the complexity of the validation depends on the source XML file itself.

There are some areas that are suggested to pay special attention to.
They are listed in the section below.

=== Areas to validate after using _mnconvert_

* Verify if the attribute values of the document are correct.
+
--
This part tends to be almost flawless after the conversion (if the
XML source is encoded properly).
However, given the importance of this area, it is a good practice to take
a quick look. Make sure that all attributes used for describing (sub)committees
are available and check whether the document is published as a `draft` or not.
--

* Remove unnecessary non-breaking spaces.
+
--
XML STS documents tend to include numerous non-breaking spaces to avoid
the split of continuity of some expressions by a line break; for example,
the white space in a percentage expression (e.g., "75&nbsp;%") should
not be broken by a line break. Nonetheless, some of the non-breaking
spaces are not necessary
in Metanorma encoding. To name one, non-breaking spaces in reference
declarations are not needed. Therefore, we ought to remove this kind of spaces,
if any.
--

* Verify if the initial text of the Normative references clause corresponds
to the usual predefined text, or if it is any other different.
+
--
In the Normative references clause, the initial paragraph will be
encoded like this after using _mnconvert_:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[NOTE,type=boilerplate]
====
The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application
of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies.
For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document
(including any amendments) applies.
====
----

If this is the case, we can remove this NOTE block as this text is
provided automatically by Metanorma.
If the text differs anyhow, it could mean that the standard's author wanted
to override the predefined text, in which case, this markup does the
job and probably should not be removed.
--

* Verify the encoding of the Terms and definitions clause.
+
--
It is advised to use `[source="REFERENCE_ANCHOR1,REFERENCE_ANCHOR_2"]`
syntax before the clause definition to generate a predefined text for the
Terms and definitions clause.
Especially pay attention to the encoding when this clause contains sub-clauses.
And of course, don't forget to check whether the terms are correctly mentioned
using `{{...}}` or `term:[...]` syntax.
--

* Verify the encoding of the source code blocks.
+
--
Source code blocks mainly contain the code without any line breaks. Insert
the line breaks and indentations where needed (or, if there are too many lines,
just copy and paste the whole code from the XML source) and check whether all the
blocks are encoded properly with the `[source]` attribute. It is preferable
to specify which programming language is used in the code block.

Sometimes, there is a need to introduce markup into the source code. If any
term is boldfaced, italicized, or underlined, it should be surrounded by
delimiters `{{{...}}}` for enabling markup; you also have the option of
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/subs/apply-subs-to-blocks/#the-subs-attribute[the subs attribute]
configured as `subs="verbatim,quotes"`, to enable rich text inside code.
--

* Check the references in Bibliography and Normative references sections.
+
--
It can happen that some reference is listed in both sections. If that is
the case, remove the reference from the Bibliography and make sure that all the
cross-references are then made with the anchor given in the Normative references
section.

Also, make sure that there are no cross-references pointing to the document itself
and that correct identifiers are given for auto-fetching the references.
--

* Verify the cross-references.
+
--
Original text often refers to the bibliographic entries differently, which makes
it hard for _mnconvert_ to convert all of them perfectly. That is mostly
noticeable in references to some specific clause, or even paragraph from some
bibliographic entry. Therefore, make sure to avoid hanging clauses in
cross-references.

Anchors mostly use underscores for dividing separate words/numbers which
specify some reference. In the AsciiDoc files generated by _mnconvert_, it is
possible that an anchor will include unnecessary whitespace before or after
an underscore, or two underscores instead of one. It is recommended to
confirm that the same anchor is used for the same reference throughout the
document and remove any needless whitespace to avoid broken cross-references.
--

* Make a quick validation of the document's encoding in general.
+
--
Last but not least, make sure the document complies with the best practices
for encoding a document in Metanorma AsciiDoc. Remove non-ASCII characters,
split lines longer than 100 characters into shorter ones, remove `width`
parameters in tables and take a quick look at the encoding in general.

NOTE: It is a good practice to use regular expressions for finding non-ASCII
characters. In this type of conversions, it is especially handy since it
finds unnoticeable non-ASCII whitespaces.

NOTE: Source XML files can also be generated with the help of OCR. Therefore,
it is possible that some characters will be wrongly written in the source file,
e.g. number `1` written as `l` and vice versa. It is advised
to check whether there are such typos in the converted AsciiDoc and to correct
them.
