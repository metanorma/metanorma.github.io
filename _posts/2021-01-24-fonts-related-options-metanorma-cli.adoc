  Learn about new font processing options now available in Metanorma CLI

== New font-related command line options

Metanorma CLI, starting from version 1.3.9, supports the following additional
font-related arguments:

* `--agree-to-terms`
* `--no-install-fonts`
* `--continue-without-fonts`

== Background

There are some fonts that we expect to be on every single platform, but it is simply not the case.

For example, the "`https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/arial[Arial]`"
font is installed by default on both Windows and macOS,
yet it is not as such on Linux. Despite Arial being an openly-licensed font for use,
an additional package or a manual install is still necessary to make
this font available on your favorite Linux distro.

A number of flavors, such as Metanorma for OGC, does require fonts like "`Arial`", and this limits
the platforms where document builds can occur -- unlike HTML, a PDF cannot be generated without
given the correct font files.


== Automatic font installs with Fontist

To make openly-licensed fonts available, Metanorma is now integrated with
https://github.com/fontist/fontist[Fontist] --
a cross-platform font installer that helps you install publicly available fonts.

Simply speaking, if Metanorma detects that a necessary font is missing on your
setup, it would automatically invoke Fontist to install the font.

NOTE: For those who are interested, the full list of fonts supported
by Fontist can be seen in its https://github.com/fontist/formulas["`Formulas`"]
repository. Since some fonts are only available from larger pieces
of software, installing those fonts can take time.


== Publicly available fonts and licensing needs

Some fonts are openly-licensed under the https://scripts.sil.org/OFL[SIL Open Font License (OFL)]
and can be installed automatically by Fontist, such
as the https://software.sil.org/fonts/[SIL fonts] and https://fonts.google.com[Google's font collection].

However, fonts like "`Arial`" from Microsoft, which we are all so familiar with,
require user acceptance of a font license.

This is clearly not something that that Metanorma or Fontist can decide for the user.


== Manual intervention needed for font installation

If you run a Metanorma flavor, such as OGC, which requires a font like Arial --
that can be installed but requires acceptance of a font license --
you will be presented with the following daunting message.

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma compile -t ogc -x xml,html,doc,pdf document.adoc
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FONT LICENSE END ("Arial")
.../fontist-1.8.4/lib/fontist/font.rb:120:in `check_and_confirm_required_license':
  Fontist will not download these fonts unless you accept the terms.
  (Fontist::Errors::LicensingError)
...
----

At this point you are prompted to enter "`YES`" or "`NO`" to indicate
acceptance or rejection of the font license.

Which is fine and dandy for a local machine, because you only need
to install it once. Once the font is installed, you will never be
asked again since Fontist is clever enough to find the font
on your machine.


== Automated font license acceptance as CLI options

However, this becomes cumbersome in an automated pipeline such as for continuous integration,
a clear need to enable non-attended installation for such fonts.

Enter the new CLI options: allowing you to indicate acceptance
of the font licenses.

Metanorma CLI starting from version 1.3.9, supports the following additional
font-related arguments under all document processing subcommands
(`compile`, `collection` and `site`):

`--agree-to-terms`::  agree to all font license agreements of necessary fonts
`--no-install-fonts`:: do not install any fonts
`--continue-without-fonts`:: continue with compilation even if necessary fonts are not installed

You can always run the command `metanorma help compile` to get
reminded of these options:

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma help compile
Usage:
  metanorma compile FILENAME

Options:
    ...
    [--agree-to-terms], [--no-agree-to-terms]
      # Agree / Disagree with all third-party licensing terms
      # presented (WARNING: do know what you are agreeing with!)
    [--no-install-fonts], [--no-no-install-fonts]
      # Skip the font installation process
    [--continue-without-fonts], [--no-continue-without-fonts]
      # Continue processing even when fonts are missing
----


We *STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU* to _manually run the font installs locally
*first* to know what font licenses you are accepting_ (on every automated run)!

Do look at the Metanorma sample document repos for reference
on how to use these options in your continuous integration flow, e.g.
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-itu[mn-samples-itu].
