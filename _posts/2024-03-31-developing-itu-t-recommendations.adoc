NOTE: Thank you for this guest post by Arnaud Taddei! This post originated
from an ITU-T SG17 training session
"_Using tools to support the development of Recommendations_".


== Hi! I'm Arnaud Taddei...

I am a Global Security Strategist at the Enterprise Security Group at
https://www.broadcom.com/[Broadcom] and
act as an executive advisor to the CISOs and executives of Fortune 150
organizations. Partly based on my other personal mission, I heavily participate
in international SDOs. I was diplomatically appointed
https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/[ITU-T]
https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/about/groups/Pages/sg17.aspx[SG17] Vice Chairman
for the UK, and regularly contribute to https://www.ietf.org[IETF].

I started my career in 1993 at the https://home.cern[CERN] IT Division in Geneva
which created the World Wide Web. In 2000, I joined
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems[Sun Microsystems] where I became
one of the 100 elected global Principal Engineers. In 2007 I joined Symantec
from Chief Architect roles up to Director of Research as direct report to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hugh_Thompson[Dr. Hugh Thompson], Symantec
then CTO and RSA Conference Chairman.

I graduated in 1992 from ENSTb and https://www.inria.fr/[INRIA], France, which
led me to the https://new.ras.ru/en/[Russian Academy of Sciences], Moscow in
1992.


== My Metanorma experience

In https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/about/groups/Pages/sg17.aspx[ITU-T SG17] I have
proposed and managed a number of ITU-T Recommendations, which are considered
"standards" in common speak.

The ITU-T standardization production pipeline of its deliverables based on
Microsoft Word has worked in the past 30 years. However, in certain use cases
and situations, this approach has showed its limits.

Text editing is no longer sufficient in managing the editorial flow, the
fragility of it and especially the difficulty in obtaining a clean history have
become a liability to all contributors.

ITU-T Study Groups as well as other SDOs are using or considering complementary
methods, and SG17 is doing the same.


== Limits of using only Word

By using Word exclusively we have run into certain limits.

Collaboration:

* It is difficult to organize large collaborations to develop the same document.

* Online sharing and collaboration works but may not be that adopted and/or a
good experience for some members.

Rise of "softwarization":

* The need for more and more API, schemas, code specifications in
Recommendations is increasing

* The need to synchronize open source with open specifications is increasing

Next generation of engineering:

* The new generation works with new tools...
* For some of the next generation, using Word is considered antiquated
* This is considered a carrier development regression vs a new normal
** Engineering management may be using e.g. GitHub to make employees assessments KPIs

Peer developments:

* Other SDOs now consider or provide complementary tools support

* A large portion of the collaboration work at the IETF is now done via GitHub
(e.g. https://github.com/tlswg[TLS working group])

* ISO engaged on the idea of https://www.iso.org/smart[SMART standards]


== Entering the challenge: X.icd-schemas

https://www.itu.int/itu-t/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=17986[ITU-T X.icd-schemas]:
_Vendor agnostic Security Data Schemas for Integrated Cyber Defense Solutions_ (SG17-TD990)
is a proposed Recommendation to SG17.

The proposed Recommendation defines vendor agnostic security data schemas that
products may use to either produce security data or consume security data in the
context of an Integrated Cyber Defense (ICD) solution.

In effect, what is being standardized is a schema (with a JSON schema) called
the ICD Schema, originally developed (by yours truly) at Broadcom. The ICD
Schema has now evolved into the
https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema[Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework Schema] (OCSF Schema)
that is a multi-vendor initiative including Amazon, Splunk, Microsoft and other
security vendors.

In other words, X.icd-schemas is what is called a "model-based standard" (MBS)
or a "model-driven standard" (MDS) -- a _specification to document a particular
data model_. In this case, the OCSF Schema is the model to be documented, and
the specification is the ITU-T Recommendation.

X.icd-schemas was originally written in Word.

However, in the real world the specification is developed:

* With a rich and complex set of JSON scripts
* Using a GitHub repository at https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema[OCSF Schema]
* Supported by a Slack community (648 participants!)

The question becomes:

* How to maintain the Word document based on a gigantic amount of JSON scripts?
* How to collaborate?


== X.icd-schemas in Metanorma

The following image shows the structure of the X.icd-schemas document.

.Metanorma input and output
image::/assets/blog/2024-03-31/01-metanorma-workflow.png[]


This document is specified as an ITU-T provisional Recommendation with the name
`X.icd-schemas`.

NOTE: A published ITU-T Recommendation is assigned a number, a provisional
Recommendation is given a meaningful short name.

The root document is named `document.adoc`, and it references a number of
content files under `sections/`.

At the top of this root document, you can see the document metadata as required
by ITU-T and SG17 encoded into document attributes.

== Advanced automation in Metanorma

=== General

As mentioned, OCSF is full of JSON content. In the Recommendation we need to
list out the many types of objects from the JSON data.

Metanorma provides a number of mechanisms for automating such data model
conversion into text.

Specifically, in `document.adoc` we use such JSON content to generate clauses
and the content within.

=== Nested `json2text` technique

Here I will introduce the "nested `json2text`" technique. Let me explain how
JSON-to-text generation works, by focusing on <1> in the previous section.

"Profile" is a defined set of cybersecurity concerns for a particular role,
such as a person, a container, a host, etc.

The typical `json2text` command allows one level of enumeration and filtering.
However, we need to list out multiple profiles, and render them all at once.

The advanced solution is to actually next layers of the `json2text` command,
as I have done here.

There are a few components in this technique:

* the *entry file* defines where generated content is inserted into the document;
* the *index file* specifies the loading of multiple data files;
* the *data file* provides data to be rendered into the template;
* the *template file* describes how the data is to be rendered.


.Nested `json2text` blocks with a Liquid template
image::/assets/blog/2024-03-31/03-json2text.png[]

The *entry file* here is called `profiles.adoc`, directly included into the root
`document.adoc`.

At the outer layer, I have prepared the *index file* that includes all *data
files* I wish to process, as a JSON file called `profiles.json`. For instance,
`security_control.json` is such a *data file*.

At the inner layer, the JSON content (e.g. from `security_control.json`) is
passed onto the *template file*, a Liquid template called `_profile.liquid`.

In `_profile.liquid`, the "Profile" JSON object (e.g. JSON content of
`security_control.json`) is converted into Metanorma syntax, and ultimately
rendered as a section (`====` indicates it is a 3rd level section).

.Contents of *entry file* `profiles.adoc`
[source,adoc]
------
=== Profiles
[json2text,sections/profiles.json,data] <1>
----
{% for path in data.paths %} <2>
[json2text, {{ path }}, profile] <3>
--
include::./profiles.liquid[] <4>
{% endfor %}
--
----
------
<1> This line means: use the `json2text` command to convert listed files in
`sections/profiles.json` and place it in the object that can be referenced as
`data`.
<2> This line means: for each path (understand file) that you find in `data`
apply the following instructions.
<3> This line means: for each file (called `path`) convert its JSON into text
and build the object `profile`.
<4> This line means that for each object `profile` render the outcome according
to the liquid template `profiles.liquid`.


=== Outer `json2text` block

The outer layer points to files that contain file paths that are meant to be
interpreted at the inner layer.

.Outer `json2text` block
[source,adoc]
------
[json2text,sections/profiles.json,data] <1>
----
...
----
------
<1> Outer block

.Contents of *index file* `profiles.json`
[source,json]
----
{
  "paths": [
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/cloud.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/container.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/datetime.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/firewall.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/host.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/network_proxy.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/person.json",
    "ocsf-schema/profiles/security_control.json"
  ]
}
----

In the *index file* `profiles.json`, each *data file* such as
`ocsf-schema/profiles/security_control.json` will be passed into the `json2text`
block to the inner layer.


=== Inner block

The inner layer passes the content read from the *data files* specified at the
outer layer such as `ocsf-schema/profiles/security_control.json` into the inner
`json2text` block.

.Inner `json2text` block
[source,adoc]
----
[json2text,ocsf-schema/profiles/security_control.json,profile] <1>
--
include::. /profiles.liquid[] <2>
{% endfor %}
--
----
<1> Inner block
<2> Rendering template

The file path given to the inner block will be loaded and its data passed
into the *template file*, the Liquid template.

[[sec_control_json]]
.Contents of *data file* `security_control.json` that is passed to the Liquid template
[source,json]
----
{
  "description": "The attributes that identify security controls such as malware or policy violations.",
  "meta": "profile",
  "caption": "Security Control",
  "name": "security_control",
  "annotations": {
    "group": "primary"
  },
  "attributes": {
    "attacks": {
      "requirement": "recommended"
    },
  // ...
  }
}
----

The *template file* `_profiles.liquid` is used to render the data loaded in the
inner block, e.g. the content of <<sec_control_json>>.

.Contents of *template file* `_profiles.liquid`
[source,adoc]
----
==== Profile: {{ profile.caption }}

{% if profile.name %}
Technical name:: `{{ profile.name }}`
{% endif %}

{% if profile.category %}
Category:: `{{ profile.category }}`
{% endif %}

{% if profile.annotations %}
Annotations::
{% for annotation in profile.annotations %}
`{{ annotation[0] }}`: {% for annotation_condition in annotation[1] %}`{{ annotation_condition }}`{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Description:: {{ profile.description | strip_html }}

{% include "event_attributes", attrs: profile.attributes, depth: 4 %}
----

The same mechanism is applied to the different classes of objects in OCSF.

=== Rendered output

Pulling all the strings above finally we have the output we expected!

The content from the `security_control.json` *data file* is now rendered using
the template into the following output.

.Rendered output of `security_control.json`

The generation process continues chugging across all different classes of data
until...

Voila! The document is complete -- a complete representation sourced from
existing model data -- transformed into a fully developed ITU-T Recommendation!


== Conclusion

https://github.com/openitu/X.icd-schemas[X.icd-schemas] is the first open
specification repository (private at this time) at the
https://github.com/openitu/[OpenITU] GitHub organization account!

NOTE: ITU experts: please contact Simao Campos to access OpenITU repositories
for reference or if your group would like to adopt this workflow.

What did we learn?

* When standardization requires a lot of automation you need tools
* Tools are powerful and allow to accomplish a lot
* For some they are very intimidating and will require significant training
* For others they will look completely genuine and `natural language`

The toolset does require new skills:

* Metanorma needs some refinements to improve the output

* The https://shopify.github.io/liquid/[Liquid template language] is powerful
but requires programming skills

* https://github.com[GitHub] is very powerful but requires a lot of practice and administration


After embarking on this journey I have the following suggestions for standards
organizations:

* Many authors now using Metanorma today for authoring standards
* SDOs could as well contact other SDOs to understand their workflow and feedback
* This is an excellent workflow to produce deliverables and worth exploring further
* This toolset would certainly match expectations of a new generation of engineers and improve perception and engagement for SDOs
* This is a good story to improve industry engagement!

Until then!
