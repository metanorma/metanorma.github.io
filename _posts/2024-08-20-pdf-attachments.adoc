  Metanorma-generated PDFs now support attachments.
---
== Introduction

NOTE: PDF attachments feature is available *from* Metanorma v1.10.0.

Increasingly, organizations are issuing PDFs that contain attachments in order
to incorporate machine-readable content.

Metanorma allows specifying the attachments for PDF documents, and generates the
hyperlinks to the attachments.

== PDF attachments

Metanorma supports per-document attachments so that users that only deal
with one document file can easily incorporate and link to the
incorporated attachments as native document elements.

Sometimes Metanorma document needs to link to non-Metanorma documents (files), 
but which need to be distributed together with the document, for instance:

* program code, 

* XML, JSON, YAML files,

* PDF files,

* executable binaries

Metanorma already supports the PDF attachments for math formulas in BIPM SI Brochure,
see our post link:../2021-08-26-pdf-accessibility-for-math-formulas[Making math accessible in Metanorma PDFs],
but now we extend this feature for used-defined attachments for all flavors.

The attachment can be added into the Metanorma document in two steps:

. encode file attachments in the bibliography section of a Metanorma document
+
```
* [[[anchor,attachment:(file path of attachment relative to current file identifier)]]]
```

. use the cross-reference to `<<anchor>>` in the document


.Example of attaching the `sources/program.c` program code file
====

```
== Scope

The sample C program: <<file1>>

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[file1,attachment:(sources/program.c)]]]

```

Any cross-references to `<<file1>>` will be point to the attachment.
