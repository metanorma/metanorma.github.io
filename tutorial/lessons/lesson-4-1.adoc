title: Compiling a Metanorma document
---
//TODO: Create own document and align with new IA.

To successfully compile a Metanorma document, the toolchain looks at:

* Metadata: The title, document flavor, and document type.
* Syntax: Is the entered AsciiDoc code correct?
* Dependencies: Are all tools needed to compile the document installed?
* File references: Are any files referred to by the file being compiled, and is their path entered correctly, for example when you include images (`image::PATH[]`). Advanced AsciiDoc usage also allows a document to embed other AsciiDoc documents (`include::PATH[]`), and Metanorma extends this in advanced usage to external data sources. 

To compile a Metanorma document:

. On the command line, go to the folder where the document you want to compile is located. 
. Enter the following command: +
[source, shell]
----
Metanorma document.adoc
----
With this command you trigger the Metanorma toolchain to:

* Read the AsciiDoc input
* Convert it into XML
* Check the XML against the document model (XML schema)
* Create HTML, PDF, and DOC output

You can also manipulate the way Metanorma compiles a document by setting flags. Flags are appended to the build command, like this:  

.Example of a build command with a flag
[source, shell]
----
Metanorma document.adoc -x html
----

You can use the following flags to manipulate the building process:

* `-t`: Sets the flavor of the document +
NOTE: Either define the flavor in the metadata using `mn-document-class` or use `-t flavor`
* `-x`: Sets the output format(s) of the document 
* `-o`: Enter a path that the output should be saved to. 

To see the full list of possible build commands, open the Metanorma help on the command line.

[source, shell]
----
Metanorma help compile
----

Because you will often encounter problems during the compilation process, we'll cover how to troubleshoot very common errors next.
