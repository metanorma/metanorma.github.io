A block image is displayed as a discrete element, i.e., on its own line, in a document. A block image is designated by image macro name and followed by two colons (`image::PATH[]`). It’s preceded by a blank line, entered on a line by itself, and then followed by a blank line.

In standard documents images are informative and you might want to reference an image in the text. As with all references, you need to define an anchor. You can also explain a graphic by adding a key. The entries of the key follow the syntax of a definition list (`key::Explanation`).
