Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far:

* Metanorma uses a what you see is what you mean (WYSIWYM) approach, meaning that the text you write is what you *want* to see.
* You need to render documents to have a correct visible output. The appearance is controlled in a stylesheet.
* Metanorma is an umbrella term for several things and consists of: +
The Metanorma toolchain, document models and a XML schema of these document models.
* Metanorma documents use Metanorma AsciiDoc markup 
* When you want to generate an output, the AsciiDoc document is converted into XML in order to be checked against the XML schema.
* If the document is valid, Metanorma generates an HTML, PDF and Microsoft Word (`.doc`) output. 

Now that we have covered the fundamentals, let’s have a look at AsciiDoc.
