Before you define an index term, your document needs a section where the index terms can appear. To create an index, define a level 1 section (==) marked with the style index at the end of your document.

Index entries can consist of up to three levels using a comma to separate the terms. Metanorma provides two options to create an index entry:

* Visible index terms are words within the text that are annotated with an index entry using double parentheses. `\((Level 1 index term))`
* Hidden index terms are index entries that are not visible in the final output and are generated using triple parentheses. `(\((Level 1 index term, Level 2 index term, Level 3 index term)))`. These allow the index to include optional subterms and sub-subterms; they also allow the index term to differ from what actually appears in the text.

Let’s have a look at an example:

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)), <1>
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))). <2>
----
<1> `\((Arthur))` will be displayed as `Arthur` in the text and carries a first level index entry
<2> `(\((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur)))` will not appear in the text, but a three level index entry will be generated.
