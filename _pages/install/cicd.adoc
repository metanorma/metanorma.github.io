== Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are crucial for
managing and authoring documents with Metanorma.

CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying documents,
ensuring that they are always up-to-date and consistent. This automation reduces
manual errors, speeds up the release cycle, and allows for continuous feedback
and improvement. By integrating Metanorma into CI/CD pipelines, users can
streamline their document workflows, maintain high-quality standards, and focus
on content creation rather than manual processes.

This guide provides an overview of how to integrate Metanorma into CI/CD platforms
and run Metanorma in a CI/CD environment.

== Principles

Integration of Metanorma into CI/CD environments consists of two phases:

* link:/install[Installing the Metanorma toolchain]
* Running Metanorma (through shell commands)

Metanorma provides a wide set of Docker images on
https://hub.docker.com/r/metanorma[Docker Hub].


== Supported platforms

Metanorma provides official support for the following CI/CD platforms:

* https://github.com/[GitHub Actions]
* https://gitlab.com/[GitLab CI]

The following platforms are supported using the Metanorma Docker containers:

* https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/[Travis CI]
* https://circleci.com/docs/using-docker/[CircleCI]
* https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/[Jenkins]
* https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/infrastructure/using-your-own-docker-image.html[Bitrise]


== Using Metanorma on a CI/CD platform

=== GitHub (through GitHub Actions)

To compile Metanorma documents on GitHub, you can use GitHub Actions. GitHub
Actions is a CI/CD service that allows you to automate your workflow directly
from your GitHub repository.

To use Metanorma in GitHub Actions, you need to create a workflow file in your
repository. The workflow file defines the steps that GitHub Actions will run when
a specific event occurs, such as a push to a branch or a pull request.

Metanorma provides a set of re-useable GitHub Actions at
https://github.com/actions-mn[`actions-mn`] that you can use in your workflow.

The following is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow file that generates a
Metanorma site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

Metanorma provides the following actions in the
https://github.com/actions-mn[`actions-mn`] repository.

https://github.com/actions-mn/setup[`actions-mn/setup`]::
Installs Metanorma (and the `metanorma` CLI) for Ubuntu, MacOS, or Windows.
+
This action can be skipped if you run CI in a Docker environment and use the
Metanorma Docker image as Metanorma is already installed.

https://github.com/actions-mn/cache[`actions-mn/cache`]::
Caches files used by and generated by Metanorma during compilation (temporary
fonts, Relaton data) to speed up subsequent runs.

https://github.com/actions-mn/build-and-publish[`actions-mn/build-and-publish`]::
Generates a Metanorma site (using the default filename `metanorma.yml`) and
uploads artifacts for deployment.

For complete workflow examples, please refer to the documentation of the
https://github.com/actions-mn/build-and-publish[`actions-mn/build-and-publish` action].

=== GitLab (using GitLab CI)

GitLab CI is a continuous integration service built into GitLab that allows you
to automate your workflow directly from your GitLab repository.

To use Metanorma in GitLab CI, you need to create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your
repository. The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the steps that GitLab CI will run
when a specific event occurs, such as a push to a branch or a merge request.

Metanorma uses the `metanorma/metanorma` Docker image to run Metanorma in GitLab CI.

Metanorma provides a set of re-useable GitLab CI configurations at the
https://github.com/metanorma/ci/main/cimas-config/gitlab-ci/[`metanorma/ci`] repository (on GitHub, not GitLab).

The workflows can be reused as follows.

=== Other platforms (using Docker)

Metanorma can be used on other CI/CD platforms by leveraging Docker. The following examples demonstrate how to set up Metanorma on Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, and Bitrise using Docker.

==== Travis CI

To use Metanorma in Travis CI, you need to create a `.travis.yml` file in your repository. The `.travis.yml` file defines the steps that Travis CI will run when a specific event occurs, such as a push to a branch or a pull request.

.`.travis.yml` file for generating a Metanorma site
[example]
====
[source,yml]
----
language: minimal

services:
  - docker

before_install:
  - docker pull metanorma/metanorma

script:
  - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/metanorma metanorma/metanorma metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----
====

==== CircleCI

To use Metanorma in CircleCI, you need to create a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository. The `.circleci/config.yml` file defines the steps that CircleCI will run when a specific event occurs, such as a push to a branch or a pull request.

.`.circleci/config.yml` file for generating a Metanorma site
[example]
====
[source,yml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: metanorma/metanorma
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Generate Metanorma site
          command: metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms

workflows:
  version: 2
  build:
    jobs:
      - build
----
====

==== Jenkins

To use Metanorma in Jenkins, you need to create a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository. The `Jenkinsfile` defines the steps that Jenkins will run when a specific event occurs, such as a push to a branch or a pull request.

.`Jenkinsfile` for generating a Metanorma site
[example]
====
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'metanorma/metanorma'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
====

==== Bitrise

To use Metanorma in Bitrise, you need to create a `bitrise.yml` file in your repository. The `bitrise.yml` file defines the steps that Bitrise will run when a specific event occurs, such as a push to a branch or a pull request.

.`bitrise.yml` file for generating a Metanorma site
[example]
====
[source,yml]
----
format_version: '8'
default_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git

workflows:
  primary:
    steps:
      - git-clone: {}
      - docker-compose:
          inputs:
            - content: |
                version: '3'
                services:
                  metanorma:
                    image: metanorma/metanorma
                    volumes:
                      - .:/metanorma
                    command: metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
