= References and bibliography

== General

In standard documents typically there are two types of references, namely
the "`normative references`" and the "`bibliography`" (informative references).

The following fixed clause names identifies a bibliography:

* `Normative references`
* `Bibliography`


Every bibliographic section must be preceded by the style attribute
`[bibliography]` so that references they contain may be recognized as such:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[id1,1]]] _First reference_
* [[[id2,2]]] _Second reference_
* [[[id3,3]]] _Third reference_
----

[example]
.Example of creating the "`Normative references`" clause in an ISO deliverable
====
In ISO, the "`Normative references`" clause is stated in
Clause 2 (ISO Directives Part 2, Clause 15), while the "`Bibliography`"
section is set as the last unnumbered section at the end of document
(ISO Directives Part 2, Clause 21). It should be typeset as the following:

[source,asciidoc]
----
...
// This is Clause 2 of an ISO deliverable
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[ISO8601-1,ISO 8601-1:2019]]] _First normative reference_
* [[[ISO8601-2,ISO 8601-2:2019]]] _Second normative reference_

...

// This is after the last clause of an ISO deliverable
[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ISO10241-1,ISO 10241-1]]] _First bibliographic reference_
...
----
====

Normative and informative references are normally recognised by the
distinct title given them, specific to the flavour; however, the normative
status of the bibliographic section can be given explicitly with
a `normative` boolean attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.7]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[bibliography,normative=true]
== References normative

...

[bibliography,normative=false]
== References informative
----

Bibliography sections can be split into subsections.
Metanorma AsciiDoc requires each subsection containing references
to be styled with `[bibliography]`, and raises an (ignorable)
warning if the subsections are contained in a section itself
styled with `[bibliography]`.

[example]
.Example of having multiple bibliography sub-sections
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Bibliography

[bibliography]
=== Part 1

* [[[id1,1]]] _First reference_
* [[[id2,2]]] _Second reference_
* [[[id3,3]]] _Third reference_

[bibliography]
=== Part 2

* [[[id4,4]]] _Fourth reference_
* [[[id5,5]]] _Fifth reference_
* [[[id6,6]]] _Sixth reference_
--
====

NOTE: A warning will be raised if `== Bibliography` in the above EXAMPLE was
preceded by `[bibliography]`.

[NOTE]
====
In Metanorma IETF, the bibliography sections "`Normative references`"
and "`Informative references`" are separate, where the
"`Informative references`" section is optional:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[id1,1]]], _First normative reference_
...

// Optional
[bibliography]
== Informative references

* [[[idn, n]]], _First informative reference_
...

--

See link:/author/ietf/topics/references/[References (AsciiRFC v3)]
for further details.
====

=== Numbering and ordering

All entries in a bibliography section, whether standards or generic,
are renumbered incrementally in the Metanorma XML. If the number for
generic references is updated, all citations of that reference will
be updated as well.

By default, Metanorma does not change the ordering of references in the
bibliography sections from what has been entered by the authors.
Some Metanorma flavours *will* reorder references to suit document
requirements.

That said, all references in a references section are grouped together,
even if there is intervening text in the source document. Only notes
are left attached to their reference, in order to enable annotated
bibliographies.

=== Predefined text

Any initial text in a Normative Reference section (before the first
reference) is replaced by predefined text specific to the Metanorma flavour.

In order to override this, initial text can be provided by the user
as a open block with "`boilerplate`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.0]
(formerly: a note of type "`boilerplate`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.9.2])

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Normative references

[.boilerplate]
--
The following contract document is referred to in the text in such a
way that some or all of its content constitutes requirements of this
document.
--
----


== Entering individual references

=== General

Bibliographic entries are entered as unordered lists in Metanorma AsciiDoc
within a dedicated clause or section.

A single bibliographic entry must be preceded by a bibliographic anchor, in
_triple brackets_, as shown in the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},{document identifier or reference tag}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

The following data elements are needed in a reference entry:

* anchor
* document identifier or reference tag
* reference list text

anchor:: a user-defined string that is an internal identifier used  for
cross-referencing within the current document. This string is typically composed
with ASCII characters and hyphens or underscores. Other characters are not
recommended. +
+
WARNING: See link:/author/topics/document-format/text#text-ref-allowed-anchors[Anchor ID syntax]
for allowed characters in anchor IDs.

document identifier:: the authoritative document identifier of the bibliographic item.
Standardized deliverables such as International Standards from ISO and IEC are
assigned authoritative identifiers, such as "ISO 8601-1" or "ISO 8601-1:2019".
This is often used for auto-fetching of bibliographic details (see <<autofetch,auto-fetch>>).
When a document identifier is used, the reference tag is also set to be identical.

reference tag:: a user-defined string used for rendering a mention of this
bibliographic item in the resulting output. This is typically in a format
defined by the user, or publication conventions adopted by the user.
See <<reference-tags>> for more information.

reference list text:: a user-defined, pre-formatted description about the
bibliographic item. This text is either formatted according to ISO 690:2021, or
publication conventions like MLA, APA or the Chicago Manual of Style.
If encoded in the ISO 690:2021 format, the resulting citation will be a
machine-readable one.


=== Types of references

There are multiple ways of entering bibliographic items in Metanorma for
referencing as shown in <<entering-refs>>.

The most commonly-used methods are:

* <<autofetch>>;
* <<annotated-spans>>;
* <<asciibib>>; and
* <<preformatted-citation>>.

It is strongly recommended that the <<autofetch,automatic fetching>> method be
used for data consistency and ease of use whenever possible (especially for
references to standards supported by Relaton).

If automatic fetching is not available for a particular reference, and if
machine-readability or accurate rendering is important, either
use <<annotated-spans,annotated citation spans>> or <<asciibib,AsciiBib>> for
entering structured and detailed bibliographic information within a document.

The basic form of a reference is a
<<pre-formatted reference,pre-formatted reference>>, which relies on the user to
supply a properly formatted reference.


[[reference-tags]]
== Reference tags

=== Implied reference tags

Bibliographic entries for standards are expected to have the standard
document identifier as the item label. References to well-defined
standards codes use the document identifiers for citations
(e.g. `ISO 20483:2013`).

This is entered as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},{document identifier as reference tag}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

[example]
.Example of implied reference tags
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO20483,ISO 20483:2013]]], _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,ISO 6540:1980]]]. _Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
--

gets rendered as:

____
* ISO 20483:2013. _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* ISO 6540:1980. _Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
____
====

A well-defined standards code as the item label will by default result in the
reference details for the bibliographic entry being auto-fetched, provided that
auto-fetching has been defined for that class of standard (<<autofetch>>).


=== Numeric reference tags

Generic references in bibliographies, as opposed to standards
references, use numbers, which are rendered bracketed, like `[1]`.

This is entered as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},{number}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

[example]
.Example of specifying numeric reference tags
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO20483,1]]], _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,1]]]. _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
--

gets rendered as:

____
* [1] _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [2] _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
____
====

NOTE: To indicate usage of the numeric reference system, any number
can be entered into the reference tag field. All references are
automatically re-sorted and auto-incremented during compilation.

Normative references must use either standard document identifiers, or named reference tags.

NOTE: Numeric references cannot be used for entries in normative references, as bibliography numbering starts at 1.
Execution will abort if a numeric reference tag is found in normative references, in order to prevent
numbering confusion [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.4].


=== Named reference tags

==== General

References can be tagged with user-supplied alphanumeric labels,
in addition to numbers or standard document identifiers.

These are indicated by wrapping the label within the bibliographic
anchor in brackets.

==== Named reference tag with fully specified bibliographic entry

If the reference text is fully specified, and where no auto-fetching of
the bibliographic entry is necessary, a user-supplied label is entered
using the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},({reference tag})]]], _{reference list text}_
--

NOTE: These alphanumeric labels will not result in the bibliographic
entry being auto-fetched.

[example]
.Sample named reference tag with fully specified bibliographic entry
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO20483,(CerMoist)]]], _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,(MaiMoist)]]]. _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
--

gets rendered as:

____
* [CerMoist] _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [MaiMoist] _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
____
====


==== Named reference tag with automatic reference fetching

Users can provide both their own alphanumeric label, and the
well-defined reference identification code for the standards document.

This will result in the bibliographic entry being auto-fetched, so long
as that auto-fetch is supported for that class of references
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.15]:

If a named reference is to be auto-fetched, it is entered by prefixing
the named reference tag (in parentheses) to the document identifier:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},({reference tag}){reference identification code}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

[[ex-named-ref]]
[example]
.Example of named reference tag fetched automatically
====

* [[[ISO6540,(MaiMoist)ISO 6540]]]. _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
----
====

Rich-text formatting is supported within the named reference tag, including
footnotes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.3].

This is useful for cases where a cited reference is out-of-date but unsuitable
to be updated.

[example]

====

WARNING: It is strongly advised not to use rich-text formatting within named
reference tags, as it can lead to unexpected results and problems with
copy-pasting.

==== Numeric reference tag with automatic reference fetching

An automatically-fetched reference can be assigned a numeric reference tag, by
using the same previous method with the sole difference of putting a number
instead of a name.

This approach is useful when working with flavors whose reference system is
named by default, such as ITU.

[example]
.Example of numeric reference tag with automatic fetching
====
[source,adoc]
----
* [[[h760,(1)ITU-T H.760]]] Recommendation ITU-T H.760 (2009), _Overview of multimedia application frameworks for IPTV services_.

* [[[x1255,(1)ITU-T X.1255]]] Recommendation ITU-T X.1255 (2013), _Framework for discovery of identity management information_.
----
====

NOTE: Any number can be entered between the parentheses.
The references will be incrementally re-sorted according to standard drafting
rules specified by the flavor during compilation.

NOTE: In the case of encoding bibliography items in ISO deliverables, this
practice is not necessary -- the reference system used in the bibliography of
ISO deliverables is already numeric by default. Numeric tags do not need to be
explicitly specified.

== Entering bibliographic references

[[autofetch]]
=== Automatic fetching via Relaton ("auto-fetch")

==== General

https://www.relaton.org/[Relaton] can fetch bibliographic entries
for any standards known to have online bibliographic databases.

Any bibliographic entry recognized through its document identifier prefix
will by default have its bibliographic entry fetched by the appropriate
Relaton extension.

The fetched data overrides any content about the item provided in the document,
since the online bibliography is treated as the source of truth for that
standards document.

==== Standards identifier / Document identifier lookup

The format of the standard identifier required for automatic lookup is documented at
link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup/[Automatic reference lookup].

NOTE: Currently Metanorma supports auto-fetching document identifiers supported
by Relaton, see https://www.relaton.org/guides/[here] for the full list.

[example]
.Example of specifying an auto-fetched reference
====
The following will trigger auto-fetching:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ref1,ISO 20483]]]
--

and gets rendered as:

____
ISO 20483:2013. _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
____
====

==== DOI identifier lookup

DOI identifiers are supported as auto-fetch targets [added in
https://github.com/relaton/relaton-cli/releases/tag/v1.14.0] through the
Crossref bibliographic information service.

This means that any book, journal article, conference paper or dataset that has
a DOI and bibliographic information at Crossref can be cited by providing its
DOI identifier as its bibliographic tag. Metanorma will import the bibliographic
details of the reference from Relaton and format them in the required format of
the current Metanorma flavour.

This is triggered by an identifier string prefixed with `doi:` or `DOI `,
followed by the full DOI identifier.

[example]
.Example of specifying an auto-fetched DOI reference
====
The following will trigger auto-fetching:

[source,asciidoc]

==== ISBN identifier lookup

ISBN identifiers are supported as auto-fetch targets [added in
https://github.com/relaton/relaton-cli/releases/tag/v1.14.0] through the
OpenLibrary API
service [added in https://github.com/relaton/relaton-cli/releases/tag/v1.17.2].

This is triggered by an identifier string prefixed with `isbn:` or `ISBN `,
with the number following the ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 number, with or without dashes.

[example]
.Example of specifying an auto-fetched ISBN reference
====
The following will trigger auto-fetching:

--

and gets rendered as:

____

____
====


=== Automatic fetching of joint publications

Metanorma recognises two types of joint publication:

* Joint publications proper (or Merged publications),
in which the one document is considered to be published simultaneously
by two different standards bodies. In the case of ISO and IEC, there are longstanding partnerships with
each other and with IEC, and this is reflected in the identifier assigned by the standards organisation
(e.g. ISO/IEC DIR 1). In other cases, the document is assigned a different identifier by each of
the standards organisations involved, but it is still considered to be the same publication, and is
described in a single bibliographic entry.

* Dual publications, for which the publications are treated as separate bibliographic entries, listed
together with phrasing like "also published as:". In dual publications, the publications are regarded
as separate activities with separate metadata, rather than a joint coordinated responsibility.
+
In case the partnership is not acknowledged in the document identifier (the documents are assigned
two separate identifiers), the two separate bibliographic entries can still be fetched by Relaton,
and brought together in the Metanorma bibliography  [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.6.1].

* `[[[anchor,merge(CODE1, CODE2)]]]` merges together the two bibliographic entries fetched under
CODE1 and CODE2: the bibliographic entry is that of CODE1, but the publication information of CODE2
(the publishing organisation and the distinct document identifier) are added to the entry. For example,
+
====
ISO 10712 | ITU-R 232. _ISO title of document_. International Organization for Standardization and International Telecommunications Union.
====

* `[[[anchor,dual(CODE1, CODE2)]]]` treats the two bibliographic entries separately. For example,
+
====
ISO 10712.  _ISO title of document_. International Organization for Standardization. Also published as: ITU-R 232. _ITU title of document_. International Telecommunications Union.
====

[[other-databases]]
=== Referencing from a Metanorma collection

Metanorma allows bibliographic entries to be specified for retrieval from a
Metanorma
collection [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

Details on author/topics/document-format/collections#collection-cross-references
This is achieved with the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[anchor,repo:(repository-name/document-entry,document-identifier)]]]
--

This retrieves item `document-entry` from repository `repository-name`; the document
identifier "document-identifier" is retained in order for citations to remain well-formed.

By default, `repo:(repository-name/document-entry)` is left in the Metanorma XML as
a document identifier, of type `repo`; it will typically be resolved in post-processing.

NOTE: The `repo:(...)` function is mutually exclusive to `path:(...)`, they
cannot be used together.

NOTE: Bibliographical information about the entry is *not* auto-fetched via Relaton.


[[hyperlink-biblio]]
=== Referencing from Metanorma or Relaton files

Metanorma allows bibliographic entries to be specified by either relative or absolute
paths [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1],
where a path leads to a Metanorma XML or a Relaton RXL reference file.

This is achieved with the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[anchor,path:(hyperlink,document-identifier)]]]
--

As with `repo:()` bibliographic entries, the document identifier
`document-identifier` is retained in order for citations to remain well-formed.

If the hyperlink is local, Metanorma will look for an XML (Metanorma XML) or RXL
(Relaton XML) file at the nominated location with the same filename, and read in
the bibliographic metadata from there.

All citations of this entry in the document (referencing `anchor`) will be
rendered with the hyperlink in HTML.

NOTE: The `path:(...)` function is mutually exclusive to `repo:(...)`, they
cannot be used together.

NOTE: Bibliographical information about the entry is *not* auto-fetched via Relaton.


[[preformatted-citation]]
=== Entering pre-formatted references

For generic references, by default, Metanorma only supports formatted
references, which are given as such in the AsciiDoc source.

[example]
.Example of a pre-formatted reference
====

NOTE: The NIST flavour of Metanorma currently supports rendering of generic
references, on an experimental basis. See the
link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup[Automatic reference lookup]
topic for more details.

[[annotated-spans]]
=== Annotating pre-formatted references using semantic elements

While a pre-formatted reference is not explicitly broken down into its semantic
components, it may be expedient to mark up segments of the reference
semantically, to provide information which is useful for parsing.

[example]
In order to generate an author-date reference, it is necessary to indicate the
author surnames and publication date.

For that reason, a limited number of span categories can be used to annotate a
pre-formatted
reference [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.6].

These are not an exhaustive list of bibliographic fields, and if more detail is
required (or a dynamically generated reference is to be generated), one of the
following explicit bibliographic entry methods should be used instead.

The span categories supported are:

* `surname`: Author surname.
* `initials`: Author initials.
* `givenname`: Author given name.
* `fullname`: Combination of author surname and initials or given names, according to strcit syntax
(see below) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.0]
* `organization`: Corporate author.
* `surname.XXX`: Contributor surname, with role _XXX_ (e.g. _editor_).
* `initials.XXX`: Contributor initials, with role _XXX_ (e.g. _editor_).
* `givenname.XXX`: Contributor given name, with role _XXX_ (e.g. _editor_).
* `fullname.XXX`: Contributor full name, with role _XXX_ (e.g. _editor_).
* `organization.XXX`: Corporate contributor, with role _XXX_ (e.g. _editor_).
* `title`: Title.
* `in_title`: Title of containing bibiographic item (for types `inbook, inproceedings, incollection`,
the title of the book, proceedings, collection containing the item).
* `in_surname`, `in_initials`, `in_givenname`, `in_organization`: Name of contributor for containing
bibliographic item (for types `inbook, inproceedings, incollection`, the author or more usually editor
of the book, proceedings, collection containing the item. So `in_surname.editor`, `in_givenname.editor`
give the name of the editor of the book or proceedings that a paper is included in).
* `series`: Series title. (For articles, this is the journal title.)
* `docid`: Document identifier.
* `docid.XXX`: Document identifier, of type _XXX_.
* `publisher`: Publisher.
* `pubplace`: Place of publication.
* `date`: Date published.
* `date.XXX`: Date with type _XXX_ (e.g. _published_, _created_, _issued_)
* `edition`: Edition
* `version`: Version
* `note`: Note (can also be used for miscellaneous content)
* `uri`: URI.
* `uri.XXX`: URI, of type _XXX_.
* `pages`: page or page range (e.g. _9_, _9-11_)
* `issue`: issue or issue range (e.g. _9_, _9-11_)
* `volume`: volume or volume range (e.g. _9_, _9-11_)
* `type`: Document type (e.g. _standard_, _book_, _inbook_): suppressed from rendering.

The list of valid document types is given in
https://www.relaton.org/specs/model/bibtype/[Relaton model -- Bibitem type].

NOTE: The surname must always precede the initials or given name for a given author in spans,
to prevent ambiguity and confusion in parsing the reference.
The rendered ordering of initials/given name and surname for the first
and for subsequent names is determined by the flavour reference stylesheet.
So `span:surname[Fields], span:initials:[W.C.]`,
never `span:initials:[W.C.] span:surname[Fields]`.

NOTE: After the first instances of `surname` and either `initials` or
`givenname`, any subsequent instances of `surname` or either `initials` or
`givenname` are interpreted as belonging to a new contributor of the same role.

NOTE: `span:fullname[]` is intended as a convenience method to substitute
`span:surname[]`, `span:initials[]`, `span:givenname[]` in a single macro. It
has a strict syntax, and any special cases need to be marked up with the
separate, explicit name parts instead:

* The surname is a single word (space-delimited), occuring at the end. So in `span:fullname[A. D. Navarro Cortez]`, only _Cortez_ is a surname: to make _Navarro Cortez_ a surname, you will need to mark it up as `span:initials[A. D.] span:surname[Navarro Cortez]`. But in `span:fullname[A. D. Navarro-Cortez]`, the surname is _Navarro-Cortez_.
* Anything before the surname is a given name. So in `span:fullnamename[J. Edgar Hoover]`, both _J._ and _Edgar_ are processed as given names.
* If everything before the surname ends in a full stop, they are all deemed initials. So in `span:fullname[A. D. Navarro Cortez]`, _A. D._ are parsed as initials.

the paper (_Collected Essays_).

After the first instances of `surname` and either `initials` or `givenname`, any
subsequent instance of `surname` is
interpreted as belonging to a new contributor of the same role.
Any given names and surnames MUST follow the surname that they relate to. If the names
are ordered differently between the first and subsequent name, e.g. _Wozniak, S. & Steve Jobs_,
that will be taken care of in rendering: they cannot be annotated in that way.

[NOTE]
--
For presentations,

* `title` is the title of the presentation
* `series` is the title of the conference
* `organization.distributor` is the organizer of the conference
--

[IMPORTANT]
--
The rendering of different bibliographic types is quite different in the various
stylesheets that SDOs follow, and strange things will happen if Metanorma gets the
bibliographic type wrong. Under Metanorma, the default bibliographic type is "standard",
and most SDOs render standards in bibliographies with very little data (no author, no
publisher, no date outside of the document identifier, and so on).

If you use this notation to enter any document other than a standard, you *must*
specify the type of document, using `span:type[]`.
--

[[emebd-citation]]
=== Overriding auto-fetched reference fields

The bibliographic `span:...[]` notation can be used to emend bibliographic
entries fetched through
Relaton [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.4].

NOTE: This is particularly important for DOI auto-fetched information, as the
Crossref records are of variable quality, and often lack crucial information for
citations.

* Data encoded in the title following the bibliographic anchor with `span:[]` is
used to supplement auto-fetched information.

* If the `span` information presents information absent in the fetched record,
it is added to the record.

* If the `span` information presents information corresponding in the fetched
record, it overwrites it.

* Information is broken down by type:

** If an identifier, or URI, or date is of a given type, it overwrites only
identifiers of the same type in the fetched record
(e.g. `span:docid.BSI[BSI EN 8000]`, `span:date.published[2010]`).

** The same applies to contributors: contributors of a given type overwrite only
contributors of the same type in the fetched record.

** For document identifiers, you will need the type of the SDO issuing the
document, which is typically the standard organization abbreviation. Look at the
Semantic XML of the document for the currently fetched document, to make sure.

* Information is replaced, not additive.
+
[example]
If there are multiple authors in the fetched record, they are replaced by the
listing of multiple authors in the bibliographic spans.

To illustrate, the following citation modifies the record fetched from Crossref.

.Metanorma bibliographic entry with DOI identifier fetch and data override
[source,asciidoc]
----
* [[[ref1,doi:10.1045/november2010-massart]]],
  span:surname.author[Johnson], span:givenname.author[Boris],
  span:pages[8-10],
  span:date.published[2021]
----

The modifications are:

* The pages span are added to the source record, which contains volume and issue
information, but no page information.

* The authors listed for the source record are overwritten by the single author
"Boris Johnson".

* The date published is overwritten by the new date 2021. The date the article
was issued, by contrast, is left alone.


[[asciibib]]
=== Entering with AsciiBib

Bibliographic entries can be entered in the AsciiBib format.

AsciiBib is a bibliography entry format that uses AsciiDoc definition lists to
capture the structure of Relaton XML.

This approach is documented in
https://www.relaton.org/asciibib/[relaton.org].

[example]
.Example of entering an entry using AsciiBib (ISO 123) with an AsciiBib ID
====
[source,asciidoc]

[%bibitem]
=== Rubber latex -- Sampling
id:: iso123
docid::
type::: ISO
id::: ISO 123
docid::
type::: ABC
id::: 32784
type:: standard
--
====

The `id` attribute of `%bibitem` clauses (the anchor of the clause) can be
overridden by a Metanorma AsciiDoc anchor on the
clause [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.1].

This can be required for Metanorma AsciiDoc to process cross-references correctly.

NOTE: Metanorma AsciiDoc anchors must not be preceded by `_`, as Metanorma
AsciiDoc uses that to indicate anchors it inserts automatically, which are not
supplied in the source.

[example]

=== Entering with Relaton XML (EXPERT only)

WARNING: This functionality is strongly discouraged due to the ease of breaking
the resulting Metanorma XML. It is useful only for limited use cases and
only intended for experts.

Bibliographic entries can also be given as raw https://www.relaton.org[Relaton XML],
in an AsciiDoc passthrough block.

Of course, any Relaton XML BibItem entries need to be valid, and using correct
`id` attributes.

[example]

[[citations_localities]]
== Citations and localities

=== General

Citations of references in Metanorma are formulated as cross-references.

The anchor cross-referenced is the internal identifier given for the
bibliographic entry.

[example]
.Example of specifying a reference anchor (`ref1` is the anchor)
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>
----
====

Metanorma AsciiDoc works in a similar way to typical AsciiDoc: any text in a
cross-reference that follows a comma constitutes custom text for the
cross-reference.

A cross-reference `\<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>` will be rendered as
"`the foregoing reference`", and hyperlinked to the `ISO7301` reference.

[[localities]]
=== Localities

==== General

Citations can include details of where in the document the citation is located.

These localities are entered by suffixing the lowercase type of locality, then
an equals sign, then the locality value or range of values.

Multiple instances of locality and reference can be provided, delimited by comma
or colon.

The references cannot contain spaces. Any text following the sequence of
localities will be displayed instead of the localities.

[[locality-types]]
==== Locality types

The following locality types are recognised in Metanorma:

* `section`: a general section
* `clause`: a clause
* `part`: a document part
* `paragraph`: a paragraph
* `chapter`: a chapter
* `page`: a page
* `line`: a line identified by the line number
* `table`: a table
* `annex`: an annex
* `figure`: a figure
* `example`: an example
* `note`: a note
* `formula`: a mathematical formula
* `list`: a list
* `time`: a particular time
* `anchor`: an anchor
* `whole`: whole
* `title`: the title

Except for the locality types of `whole` and `title`, all locality types require
explicit specification of an identifier to make sense.

.Example locality types that are used on their own
[example]
====
* `whole`
* `title`
====

.Example locality types that need to be used with identifiers
[example]
====
* `note 1` (or `note=1`)
* `page 77-99` (or `page="77-79"`)
* `annex A` (or `annex=A`)
* `line 399` (or `line=399`)
====

Locality types not listed here shall be entered using the mechanism described at
<<custom-locality>>.

==== Simple locality

A simple locality is specified with a unique location identifier or free text.

[example]
.Example of referencing locality in Metanorma citations
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO7301,clause=3.1-3.4>>

NOTE: This table is based on <<ISO7301,table=1>>.

Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with <<xxx,section="5-3-1,bis">>
----
====

[example]
.Example that renders a reference as free text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "the foregoing reference"
<<ISO712,the foregoing reference>>
----
====

To refer to the "`whole`" item, or the title within a block, the corresponding keyword is used
(`whole`, `title`), without an argument.

[example]
.Example of referencing with a "whole" locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Whole of text"
<<ISO712,whole>>
----
====


==== Hierarchical locality

A hierarchical location is specified through consecutive narrower localities.

[example]
.Example of referencing a hierarchical locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "`Part IV, Chapter 3, paragraph 12`"
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>
----
====

[example]
.Example that renders the reference with (multiple) hierarchical localities
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Section 5, Page 8-10"
<<ISO712,section=5, page 8-10>>
----
====

[example]
.Example of referencing locality with additional text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "ISO 712, 5:8-10"
// ("5:8-10" treated as replacement text for all the foregoing)
<<ISO712,section=5, page=8-10: 5:8-10>>
----
====

==== Discontinuous locality

Discontinuous localities can be named by repeating the same locality type.

[example]
.Example of referencing a discontinuous locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "`page 4, page 7`"
<<ref1,page=4,page=7>>
----
====

Discontinuous localities can also be specified by delimiting sequences of
localities with semicolon [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.24] +

[example]
.Example of referencing discontinuous hierarchical localities
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "`Part IV, Chapter 3; Part VI, Chapter 9`"
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3;part=VI,chapter=9>>
----
====

==== Complex locality

Complex relations between discontinuous references can be specified by
prefixing conjoining verbs to sequences of localities separated
by semicolon [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4].

This will result in overt connectives between the references, which will be
internationalised.

Conjoining verbs include:

* `and!`
* `or!`
* `from!`
* `to!`

[example]
.Example of referencing a complex locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "`Chapters 3 and 7`"
<<chapter=3;and!chapter=7>>
----
====

[example]
.Example of referencing a complex locality that contains a hierarchical locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "Part IV, Chapter 3 or Part VI, Chapter 9"
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3;or!part=VI,chapter=9>>
----
====

NOTE: This is similar to the behavior in
link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs/#combined-xrefs[Combination of cross-references].

As with cross-references, more than two references combined by "`and`" should be
marked up with semicolons. Internationalisation during rendering will take care
of separating the references by colon, and inserting any necessary conjunction
wording ("`and`").

[example]
.Example of referencing multiple references that are complex localities
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ref1,clause=3.2;clause=4.7;clause=4.9;clause=9>>
// or
<<ref1,clause=3.2;and!clause=4.7;and!clause=4.9;and!clause=9>>
----
====

NOTE: If references are joined with semicolons and connectives, but the locality is not supplied
for a cross-reference, it is filled in by referring to the preceding conjoined
cross-reference [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.0].
For example, `<<ref1,clause=3.2;and!4.7;to!4.9;and!9>>` is
corrected internally to the more explicit `<<ref1,clause=3.2;and!clause=4.7;to!clause=4.9;and!clause=9>>`.

Trailing text after the sequence of `locality=reference` (or
`locality{space}reference`) is treated as custom text for the cross-reference,
as would occur normally in a typical cross-reference.

The locality can appear in quotations if it contains special characters (like
dashes or commas).

[[custom-locality]]
==== Custom locality

Locality types not listed in <<locality-types>> are entered using the
"custom locality" functionality.

Metanorma accepts a fixed list of locality types in cross-references (see
<<locality-types>>), which is not meant to be exhaustive of all possible
locality types.

[example]
`annex` is recognized as a generic reference to annexes in documents, but it
does not recognize appendixes (instead of annexes), or as distinct from annexes
(as is the case in ISO deliverables).

A custom locality is entered by prefixing the locality type with `locality:`.

A custom locality has the following properties:

* The locality type will be rendered as text preceding the equal sign.

* The locality type shall not contain commas, colons, or space.

* The locality type is meant to be valid for all languages.
+
NOTE: The custom locality `locality:appendix` would be used for both English
and French texts.

* Localization of custom locality types is managed through inclusion in the
internationalization YAML file for that language, which has to be customized
as part of the Metanorma flavor implementation.
+
NOTE: The custom locality `locality:appendix` is realized as French _Appendice_
through configuration in the Metanorma flavor implementation.


[example]
.Example of referencing a custom locality the `locality:` prefix
====
This encoding:

[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO-IEC_DIR_1_ISO_SUP,annex=SL,locality:appendix=2,clause=3.2>>
----

Renders as:

____
"ISO/IEC DIR 2, Annex SL, Appendix 2, Clause 3.2"
____
====


==== Locality plus custom text

Any text after the bibliographic localities is still treated as custom
cross-reference text.

As with references without localities, the custom cross-reference text is the
only text that is displayed in the document; but the cross-reference still
captures the specific locality of the reference, e.g. for cross-reference
generation.

[example]
.Example of referencing with bibliographic localities with additional custom text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO7301,clause=5,table=1,the foregoing reference>>
----

rendered as:

____
the foregoing reference
____
====

==== Anchor locality

Exceptionally, the `anchor` locality is only used in HTML, to generate
anchor links to other HTML pages [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

It is intended for use with bibliographic anchors linking to URLs (`repo:()`, `path:()`):
see <<other-databases>> and <<hyperlink-biblio>>.


[example]
.Example of using the `anchor` locality for rendering in HTML output
====
The following input:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=2,table=1a,page=7-9,anchor=xyz>>

...

* [[[ISO7301,path:(./iso7301.html,ISO 7301)]]]
--

will render in HTML as:

[source,html]
--
<a href="./iso7301.html#xyz">ISO 7301, Clause 2, Table 1a, page 7-9</a>
--
====

==== Case and dropped locality labels

The `capital%`, `lowercase%` and `droploc%` options used for internal
cross-references can also be used as prefixes to localities, modifying how those
localities are
rendered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.9].


[example]
.Example of using `droploc` in a citation locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
// renders as "ISO 7301, 2"
<<ISO7301,droploc%clause=2>>
--
====

[example]
.Example of using `lowercase` in a citation locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
// renders as "ISO 7301, clause 2"
<<ISO7301,lowercase%clause=2>>
--
====

==== Styled cross-references

As with link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs#xref-styles[internal cross-references], cross-referenced
citations can have a `style` attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.4].
As of this writing, the only values allowed are the types of docidentifier value that can be substituted
for the primary identifier of the reference, for standards documents; those values will need to be looked up in
Relaton (and the Semantic XML of the document). For example, given the citation

[source,xml]
----
<bibitem type="standard" id="bib1">
...
<docidentifier type="ISO" primary="true">ISO/FDIS 17664-1</docidentifier>
<docidentifier type="URN">urn:iso:std:iso-fdis:17664:-1:ed-1:fr</docidentifier>
...
</bibitem>
----

a crossreference `<<bib1>>` will be populated by default with the primary or else the first
`docidentifier` value found, `ISO/FDIS 17664-1`. However, given `<<bib1,style=URN%>>`, the
first `docidentifier` value of type `URN` will be sought instead, and the cross-reference
will be populated by default as `URN urn:iso:std:iso-fdis:17664:-1:ed-1:fr`.


=== Link-only references

A standards document can be cross-referenced in Metanorma without that document
appearing in the document references.

Such cross-reference is treated as equivalent to a cross-reference
to a hidden citation, as documented in <<hidden-citations>>.

Link-only references can be added to Metanorma AsciiDoc using the following
command:

[source,adoc]
----
++std-link:[...]++
----

Where the `std-link` command contains the same text as a normal cross-reference
to a standard, including localities and other directives.
There is no need for an explicit bibliographic entry. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4].

The following two examples are equivalent:

[example]
.Link-only reference of ISO 123 using `std-link`
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
std-link:[ISO 123,droploc%clause=3]
----
====

[example]
.Link-only reference of ISO 123 using a hidden citation
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ref1,droploc%clause=3>>

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ref1,hidden(ISO 123)]]]
----
====

=== Combination of citations

Simple citations can be combined with connectives, in a similar fashion to cross-references
(link:/author/topics/building/xrefs/#combined-xrefs[Combination of cross-references]),
and which will be internationalised as
appropriate [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.7].

[example]
.Example of rendering a range of citations
====
The following citation range:

[source,adoc]
----
<<from!context;to!improvement>>
----

is rendered as:

____
From [3] to [7]
____
====


== Reference processing flags

=== General

Various processing flags can be entered at the document identifier element to
specify different reference processing behaviour. All such flags are optional.

Reference processing flags need to be entered according to the following pattern
(in this order):

[source,adoc]
----
[[[{anchor},nofetch(hidden(dropid({document identifier or reference tag})))]]]
----

`nofetch()`:: Disable automatic lookup of references. See <<disable-auto-fetch>>

`hidden()`:: Do not show this item in the bibliography. See <<hidden-citations>>.

`dropid()`:: Do not display the document identifier. See <<dropid>>.


NOTE: The `repo:()` and `path:()` functions are to be entered as document
identifiers in this pattern.

[[disable-auto-fetch]]
=== Disable auto-fetch with `nofetch()`

See link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup/#nofetch[Automatic reference lookup: Disabling automatic lookup].


[[dropid]]
=== Ignoring document identifiers with `dropid()`

The document identifier is critical to formulating both citations and
bibliographies. There are times, however, where the supplied document identifier
is to be ignored in bibliographies.

When a manual bibliographic item is entered (not auto-fetched),
with a user-defined anchor and the document identifier in triple brackets,
followed by bibliographic details provided as text.

In this case, the bibliographic item is rendered with the document identifier
placed in brackets after the provided bibliographic details, as it is shown in
<<dropid-example-1>>.

[[dropid-example-1]]
[example]
.Example of a manually-entered bibliographic item with document identifier shown after bibliographic details
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
* [[[id1,ELOT 743]]], _Transliteration of Greek into Roman script._
----

Notice that the document identifier is placed in brackets after the provided
bibliographic details:

____
[1] _Transliteration of Greek into Roman script._ [ELOT 743]
____
====

There are situations where it is useful to suppress the document identifier in
the bibliography, for example:

* the bibliographic item is not a standard, so the identifier should not be
used;

* there is no authoritative form for the document identifier for this
bibliographic item.

The `dropid()` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.4]
citation processing flag can be used to suppress the appearance of the document
identifier in the bibliography.

[example]
.Example of using `dropid(...)` to drop rendering of a document identifier in the bibliography
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
* [[[id1,dropid(GIBBON)]]], Gibbon, Edward. 1776-1789. _Decline and fall of the Roman Empire._ London: Strahan & Cadell.
----

The resulting rendering omits the document identifier:

____
[1] Gibbon, Edward. 1776-1789. _Decline and fall of the Roman Empire._ London: Strahan & Cadell.
____
====



[[hidden-citations]]
=== Hiding citations with `hidden()`

It is possible to add a citation to a document while suppressing its rendering
in all rendered outputs.

This is done so that the Metanorma Semantic XML will still contain information
about the citation, and can use it, for instance, to populate cross-references
to that document.

A hidden citation can be added to a Metanorma document by wrapping the reference
tag in `hidden(...)`. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.0]

[example]
.Example of hiding a named reference (ISO 8601-1:2019)
====
The following encoding will hide the particular bibliographic reference.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[iso86011,hidden(ISO 8601-1:2019)]]]
--
====

=== CSV notation

The notation shown up to this point for reference processing flags has the potential of being too complicated
to parse, if deeply nested or if the parentheses of flags are combined with the parentheses of user-supplied
labels or of "all parts". For that reason, an alternative notation is supported, involving key/value pairs
delimited by comma and equals signs in the anchor label [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.4].
For example, the following two references are equivalent:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[iso8601_1,nofetch((Date-Time)ISO 8601-1:2019)]]], _Date and time — Representations for information interchange — Part 1: Basic rules_
* [[[iso8601_1a,nofetch=true,usrlabel=Date-Time,code=ISO 8601-1:2019]]], _Date and time — Representations for information interchange — Part 1: Basic rules_
----

The CSV-based notation has the following keys:

`nofetch`:: `true`|`false`
`hidden`:: `true`|`false`
`dropid`:: `true`|`false`
`local-file`:: (filename of local Relaton cache)
`repo`:: (repository name)/(document entry)
`path`:: (file path)
`number`:: (number, for a numeric ID of a citation)
`usrlabel`:: (user-supplied label of reference)
`code`:: (authoritative identifier of reference)

If no key is supplied in the CSV entry, it is assumed to be a code; e.g. `nofetch=true,usrlabel=Date-Time,ISO 8601-1:2019`
is interpreted as `nofetch=true,usrlabel=Date-Time,code=ISO 8601-1:2019`.
