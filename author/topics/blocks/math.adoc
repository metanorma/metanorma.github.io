== Mathematical expressions

=== General

Metanorma AsciiDoc accepts mathematical input in these formats:

* AsciiMath
* LaTeX math
* MathML

Math can be entered using one of the following mechanisms:

* the `\stem:[...]`, `\asciimath:[...]` and the `\latexmath:[...]` commands; and
* the `[stem]`, `[asciimath]`, `[latexmath]` blocks delimited with `\++++{blank}`

The math syntax used by `\stem:[...]` and `[stem]` blocks depends on
the value of the document attribute `:stem:`. It can be set to:

`:stem: latexmath`:: any markup within `stem` is interpreted as LaTeX math
`:stem: asciimath`:: any markup within `stem` is interpreted as AsciiMath
`:stem:`:: (default) when left empty, AsciiMath is selected

`\stem:[...]` and `[stem]` markup that contains MathML markup
(as detected by an initial `<math ... >`) is interpreted as MathML.

MathML is used as the internal representation of STEM expressions in Metanorma.


=== Using AsciiMath

AsciiMath can be entered using the `\asciimath:[...]` command and the
`[asciimath]` block delimited with `\++++{blank}`.
The `\stem:[]` and `[stem]` blocks can also be used if the document attribute
`:stem: asciimath` has been specified in the document.

AsciiMath is converted into MathML using the
https://github.com/plurimath/plurimath[plurimath] gem.

The syntax of AsciiMath recognized by `plurimath` can be more strict
than the common MathJax processor of AsciiMath.

[source,asciidoc]
----
The derivative of a distribution stem:[D] is another distribution
stem:[D'] defined for any function stem:[f](stem:[x]) by
stem:[D^( ' ) ( f ) = - D ( d f // d x )].

WARNING: Some math expressions are NOT supported by AsciiMath. In that case it
is necessary to use LaTeX math or MathML input.

[WARNING]
.Encoding brackets inside stem:[]
====
When we encode inline math expressions that contain brackets we have have to
make sure of two things:

. The closing bracket must be escaped, `\]`.

. If the opening bracket is the first character of the expression, there should be
a white space between `stem:[` and the opening bracket; i.e. `stem:[ [...`.
Otherwise, the engine may interpret the double-opening brackets `[[`  as the
beginning of an anchor definition.

As an example, suppose we want to encode this inline expression: stem:[[x_n,y_n\]]. +
The correct encoding to avoid misinterpretations would be: `\stem:[ [x_n,y_n\]]`
====

=== Using LaTeX math

LaTeX math can be entered using the `\latexmath:[...]` command and the
`[latexmath]` block delimited with `\++++{blank}`.
The `\stem:[]` and `[stem]` blocks can also be used if the document attribute
`:stem: latexmath` has been specified in the document.

LaTeX math is converted into MathML using
https://github.com/plurimath/plurimath[Plurimath].

NOTE: LaTeX math generated is compliant with the deterministic output of the
https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/[NIST LaTeXML] suite.

NOTE: Previously Metanorma used the https://github.com/plurimath/latexmath[latexmath] gem,
which is now superseded by Plurimath.

NOTE: Previously, Unicode characters in the LaTeX source were translated into LaTeX escapes
through the https://github.com/metanorma/unicode2latex[unicode2latex] gem.
This is superseded by Plurimath.

The only change from the above example would be the
nondimensionalization of viscosity, which would become,
latexmath:[\tilde{\tilde{\mu}} = mu / (rho_infty c_infty L)].

  \tilde{y} = y/L, \tilde{v} = v/c_\infty, \tilde{p} = p/(\rho_\infty c_\infty^2),
  \tilde{z} = z/L, \tilde{w} = w/c_\infty, \tilde{\mu} = \mu/\mu_\infty,

The LaTeX math `eqnarray` environment is not supported in Metanorma as
it is not supported by LaTeXML and the latexmath gem.
It is also not recommended by the general
LaTeX community due to inconsistencies in vertical alignment and other aspects
(see link:https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf[Madsen]).

The proper LaTeX math syntax used to replace existing `eqnarray`
equations is to place the equations in separate blocks concatenated
with `+`.

[example]
.Replacing LaTeX math `eqnarray` in Metanorma with separate equations
====
These equations using the `eqnarray` environment:

[source,asciidoc]

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \bf{z^\prime} & = & \bf{\zeta} \\
  \bf{x^\prime} & = & \langle \bf{\eta} \times \bf{\zeta} \rangle
\end{eqnarray*}
++++
--

should be re-arranged as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[latexmath]
++++
\bf{z^\prime} = \bf{\zeta}
++++
+
[latexmath]
++++
\bf{x^\prime} = \langle \bf{\eta} \times \bf{\zeta} \rangle
++++

=== Formulae

==== General

Formulae are marked up as `[stem]` blocks.

==== Equations

In most flavours, equations and inequalities are both referenced in the same
way, as "`Formula`".

In some flavours (e.g. ITU), they are referenced differently as "`Equations`"
and "`Inequalities`".


==== Inequalities

Inequalities are indicated through the option attribute `%inequality`:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem%inequality]
++++
{formula-content}
++++
--

Where:

* `{formula-content}` is content within a formula.

[example]

====

==== Key

Explanation of symbols used in the formula is specified in a "key" list, which is
specified as a definition list with the `[%key]`
option [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.3].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem]
s++++
{some-formula}
++++

[%key]
stem:[{some-symbol}]:: {symbol-description}
--

Where:

* `{some-formula}` represents content within a formula
* `{some-symbol}` represents a symbol within the formula
* `{symbol-description}` is text that describes information about the symbol

[example]
.Example of including a key for a formula (`stem`) block
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem]
++++
w = (m_D) / (m_s)
++++

[%key]
stem:[w]:: is the mass fraction of grains with a particular defect in the test sample;
stem:[m_D]:: is the mass, in grams, of grains with that defect;
stem:[m_S]:: is the mass, in grams, of the test sample.
--

renders as:

====

Instead of `[%key]`, the definition list can also be preceded with a paragraph
containing the English word `where`, though this is not recommended practice.
