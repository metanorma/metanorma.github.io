= Examples

== General

Examples are used to demonstrate to the reader a sample application of a
piece of content, such as a concept, or a requirement.

== Explicitly-defined terminology examples

Normally, examples are only tagged as term examples when they appear in the
context of a terms section.

Rarely, term examples need to be presented in isolation, including in
ISO Amendments or Technical Corrigenda.

To achieve that, mark the example up with `%termexample` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.2].
