== Images

=== General

Images are inserted into a Metanorma AsciiDoc document through the `image`
command.

There are two types of AsciiDoc images:

* block image;
* inline image.

Metanorma AsciiDoc supports most of the features of `image` defined in
Asciidoctor AsciiDoc.

Please refer to link:/author/topics/blocks/figures[figures] for details on how
to use images within figures.

This page mainly describe Metanorma AsciiDoc behavior.
For typical `image` command attributes, refer to
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[Asciidoctor AsciiDoc].


=== Block image
tag::tutorial[]

A *block image* is displayed as a discrete element, i.e., on its own line,
in a document.

The syntax used to enter a block image is as follows.

The `image::` line is preceded by a blank line, entered on a line by itself,
and then followed by a blank line.

[source,adoc]
----
image::{PATH}[]
----

Where `PATH` is the image path.

In Metanorma, block images are always entered as a figure. Please refer to the
documentation on link:/author/topics/blocks/figures[Figures].

.Including a block image
====
[source,adoc]
----
[[my-anchor]] <1>
.Title for image <2>
image::images/path.png[Alt text] <3>
----
<1> Optional anchor for referencing
<2> Image title
<3> Image command with path and optional alt text. If no alt text is provided,
leave the square brackets at the end empty (`image::path[]`).
====

end::tutorial[]


=== Inline image

An *inline image* is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a
paragraph.

This is useful when you want to incorporate buttons or other icons inside the
text flow.

Inline images are inserted using the inline image command:
`image:[]` (instead of `image::[]`).

.Including an inline image into text flow
====
[source,adoc]
----
This is an inline image:{PATH}[], appearing within a paragraph.
----
====

Where `PATH` is the image path.


=== Data URIs

Metanorma allows
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs[Data URIs]
as the address for an image:

.Including an image via Data URI
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::data:image/png;base64,ivBO...[alt text]
--
====

NOTE: Data URIs are only supported by Metanorma AsciiDoc, not other AsciiDoc
processors.


=== Image directory root path

The root path for all `image` paths can be defined at the document-level,
through the document attribute `:imagesdir:`.

.Setting an image directory root path
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
= Document title
:imagesdir: my-images <1>

...
image::myimage01.png[] <2>
----
<1> The document attribute `:imagesdir:` will set all root paths of the `image`
command to the specified path.
<2> The reference to `myimage01.png` is joined with the path set at
`:imagesdir:`, which results to `my-images/myimage01.png`.
====

More details of the `:imagesdir:` attribute can be found at documentation of
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images-directory/[Asciidoctor AsciiDoc].


=== Attributes

==== Image size

Size of an image can be modified via the `height` and `width` attributes.

* By default, both `height` and `width` are set to the value `auto`, which means
that the image will be shown according to the best visual settings determined
by Metanorma.

* Image dimensions can be fixed with pixel values with `px`.

NOTE: The pixel is the only currently supported unit in image sizing.

[example]
====
.Image resizing specifying `height` and `width` attributes in pixels
[source]
----
image::logo.jpg[height=150px,width=100px]
----
====

In the `height` and `width` attributes, the `px` suffix may be omitted.

[example]
====
.Image resizing with values omitting `px` unit
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[height=150,width=100]
--
====

The `auto` value indicates that the dimension does not have a fixed size but
retain the aspect ratio of the original image.

====
.Aspect ratio is retained with `width` set to `auto` based on the value of `height`
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[height=150,width=auto]
--
====

An unspecified dimension is considered `auto`.

====
.Aspect ratio is retained when setting `height` but not `width`
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[height=150]
--
====

NOTE: Treatment of image resizing may slightly differ across output formats.


==== Other attributes

NOTE: For general attributes of the `image` command, please refer to the
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/image-ref/[Asciidoctor AsciiDoc]
documentation.
