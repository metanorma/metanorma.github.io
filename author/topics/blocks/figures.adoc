== General

Figures are document elements that present non-textual material.

Figures are independently referable, and are considered to be referenceable
document blocks.

In Metanorma, a figure in Metanorma is defined as a block (implied or explicitly
defined) that contains at least one image.

A figure can contain the following content:

* image (mandatory)
* paragraph
* admonition
* key / legend
* preformatted text

Please refer to link:/author/topics/blocks/images[images] for details
of the `image` command.

NOTE: This page discusses only the markup specific to figures as blocks,
using the image command `image::[]`.


== Basic figure

A link:/author/topics/blocks/images[block image] in isolation is automatically
considered as a figure containing an image.

.Basic figure composed of just one image
====
A single block image in isolation is treated as a figure.

[source,asciidoc]
--
.Figure title
image::{PATH}.png[]
--
====


== Figure block

A figure block can contain multiple types and instances of content, such as
images, paragraphs and admonitions.

A figure block is encoded as an example block with the
`[figure]` role [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.7].

.Explicit figure declaration
=====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[figure]
.Figure title
====
image::{PATH}.png[alt text]

This is explanatory text.

NOTE: And this is a note.
====
--
=====

NOTE: Previously the explicit declaration on the example block uses the
`[.figure]` role.


== Captions and titles

=== General

A caption and a title on a figure block are different things.

* The caption is a textual description describing the figure.
* The title is a name of the figure.

=== Caption

As elsewhere in Metanorma, the caption of an image (of the figure containing the
image) is set with a line prefixed with dot above the image.

.Figure with caption
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Caption
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====


.Figure with caption declared in the image
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[title=Caption]
--
====

NOTE: Similar to Asciidoctor AsciiDoc, the `title` attribute is treated as
identical to the dot-prefixed caption.


=== Title

Metanorma supports a `title` attribute on images for accessibility, which is
distinct from the figure caption.

This is entered in Metanorma as the `titleattr` attribute.

.Figure with accessible `titleattr` title
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[titleattr=Title Attribute]
image::logo.jpg
--
====

Or

.Figure with accessible `titleattr` title declared in image
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Title Attribute]
--
====


Both captions and titles could be used together.

.Figure with both caption and title
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Rice husk separation in rice farm at Breton near Dinan
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Photo of rice husks being separated]
--
====

NOTE: Word exception. The `titleattr` attribute does not get rendered in Word
output due to Word limitations. Word only supports a single image "`Alt Text`",
which would be set by the caption.
Word's description of "`Alt Text`" is:
"`How would you describe this object and its context to someone who is blind?`".


== Key

Figures can be followed by a definition list for the variables
used in the figure, just like formulae.

This definition list is marked up with `[%key]`
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.3].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[some-anchor]] <1>
.Figure title <2>
image::figure-path.png[] <3>

[%key] <4>
{some-id}:: {some-description} <5>
--
<1> Optional anchor for referencing
<2> Title of the figure
<3> The image command with path
<4> Specification of figure key section
<5> Key entry: `{some-description}` is text that describes information about the thing
represented by `{some-id}`


[example]
.Figure containing a key / legend (from ISO Rice document)
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[]
footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

[%key]
stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.
--
====

The key definition list can also be preceded by a paragraph consisting of
`\*Key*`, though that is not recommended.

[example]
.Figure containing a key / legend using `*Key*` syntax (from ISO Rice document)
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[alt text]
footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

*Key*

stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.
----
====


== Notes and footnotes

Notes and footnotes can be encoded as part of a figure. Both types are
rendered in the figure footer, below the Key.

To encode figure notes and footnotes:

* Notes (`NOTE: ...`) entered immediately a figure is considered to be a figure
note, and hence included in the figure.

* Footnotes (`footnote:[...]`) part of the textual content of the figure
or notes are included in the figure.

.Example of a figure with a note and a footnote
====
[source,adoc]
----
.Amount of gelatinization of husked rice through time footnote:[at 1 Pa]
image::rice_images/rice_image10-1.png[]

[NOTE]
Husked rice gelatinized through the Verrol process.
----
====

[TIP]
====
Figure C.1 in the Metanorma ISO Rice example document illustrates a large range
of figure formatting options.
====


[[statement-units]]
== Statement concerning units

A statement concerning units used can be added to a figure, indicating the units
of measurement used in the figure.

NOTE: This currently applies to the ISO, IEC and BSI flavors, and flavors that
inherit from them.

The units statement is encoded as a NOTE of type `units` (`[NOTE,type=units]`).

The statement is rendered in the top-right corner of the
figure [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.3.6].

.Figure with a statement concerning units
====
[source,adoc]
----
.Amount of gelatinization of husked rice through time
image::rice_images/rice_image10-1.png[]

[NOTE,type=units]
Amount in grams; time in seconds.
----
====


== Subfigures

Subfigures are entered by including multiple images in an example block.

NOTE: Subfigures commonly appear in the ISO/IEC flavors.

[example]
.Figure with 3 subfigures (from ISO Rice document)
=====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Stages of gelatinization
====
.Initial stages: No grains are fully gelatinized (ungelatinized starch granules are visible inside the kernels)
image::rice_images/rice_image3_1.png[]

.Intermediate stages: Some fully gelatinized kernels are visible
image::rice_images/rice_image3_2.png[]

.Final stages: All kernels are fully gelatinized
image::rice_images/rice_image3_3.png[]
====
--
=====


== Preformatted content

Figures can include preformatted content.

[example]
.Figure with a preformatted block
=====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[figure]
.Hexagram 46 "Ascending"
====
....
|===| |===|
|===| |===|
|===| |===|
|=========|
|=========|
|===| |===|
....
====
----
=====


For accessibility, preformatted blocks can be provided with an `alt` text
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

[example]
.Figure with preformatted block with alt text
=====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[figure]
====
[alt=ASCII art of a dog]
....
     ___^_
   /    | \__/\
    \   /  ^ ^|
   / \_/   0  0_
  /             \
 /     ___     0 |
/      /  \___ _/
....
====
----
=====


== Class

Figures in documents can belong to different classes (e.g. _Plate_, _Chart_,
_Diagram_), each of which can be auto-numbered and captioned differently.

To set this, the desired class can be indicated through the `class`
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.5].

.Figure with specific class
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[class=plate]
.Rice husk separation in rice farm at Breton near Dinan
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====


== Source

A figure block can incorporate an indication of its source.

To set this, the source is expected to be a bibliographical reference, just as
with term
sources [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.2].
