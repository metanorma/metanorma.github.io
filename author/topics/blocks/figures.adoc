== General

Figures are document elements that present non-textual material.

Figures are independently referable, and are considered to be referenceable
document blocks.

In Metanorma, a figure in Metanorma is defined as a block (implied or explicitly
defined) that contains at least one image.

A figure can contain the following content:

* image (mandatory)
* paragraph
* admonition
* key / legend
* preformatted text

Please refer to link:/author/topics/blocks/images[images] for details
of the `image` command.

NOTE: This page discusses only the markup specific to figures as blocks,
using the image command `image::[]`.


== Basic figure

A link:/author/topics/blocks/images[block image] in isolation is automatically
considered as a figure containing an image.

.Basic figure composed of just one image
====
A single block image in isolation is treated as a figure.

[source,asciidoc]
--
.Figure title
image::{PATH}.png[]
--
====


== Figure block

A figure block can contain multiple types and instances of content, such as
images, paragraphs and admonitions.

A figure block is encoded as an example block with the
`[figure]` role [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.7].

.Explicit figure declaration
=====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[figure]
.Figure title
====
image::{PATH}.png[alt text]

This is explanatory text.

NOTE: And this is a note.
====
--
=====

NOTE: Previously the explicit declaration on the example block uses the
`[.figure]` role.


== Captions and titles

=== General

A caption and a title on a figure block are different things.

* The caption is a textual description describing the figure.
* The title is a name of the figure.

=== Caption

As elsewhere in Metanorma, the caption of an image (of the figure containing the
image) is set with a line prefixed with dot above the image.

.Figure with caption
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Caption
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====


.Figure with caption declared in the image
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[title=Caption]
--
====

NOTE: Similar to Asciidoctor AsciiDoc, the `title` attribute is treated as
identical to the dot-prefixed caption.


=== Title

Metanorma supports a `title` attribute on images for accessibility, which is
distinct from the figure caption.

This is entered in Metanorma as the `titleattr` attribute.

.Figure with accessible `titleattr` title
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[titleattr=Title Attribute]
image::logo.jpg
--
====

Or

.Figure with accessible `titleattr` title declared in image
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Title Attribute]
--
====


Both captions and titles could be used together.

.Figure with both caption and title
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Rice husk separation in rice farm at Breton near Dinan
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Photo of rice husks being separated]
--
====

NOTE: Word exception. The `titleattr` attribute does not get rendered in Word
output due to Word limitations. Word only supports a single image "`Alt Text`",
which would be set by the caption.
Word's description of "`Alt Text`" is:
"`How would you describe this object and its context to someone who is blind?`".


== Supplementary components

A figure allows the following supplementary components:

* Key
* Text
* Notes
* Footnotes

The order of rendering of these components are in the following order:

* Key > Text > Note > Footnote

NOTE: This order aligns with ISO's editorial practice.


== Key

Figures can be followed by a definition list for the variables
used in the figure, just like formulae.

This definition list is marked up with `[%key]`
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.3].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[some-anchor]] <1>
.Figure title <2>
image::figure-path.png[] <3>

[%key] <4>
{some-id}:: {some-description} <5>
--
<1> Optional anchor for referencing
<2> Title of the figure
<3> The image command with path
<4> Specification of figure key section
<5> Key entry: `{some-description}` is text that describes information about the thing
represented by `{some-id}`


[example]
.Figure containing a key / legend (from ISO Rice document)
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[]
footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

[%key]
stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.
--
====

The key definition list can also be preceded by a paragraph consisting of
`\*Key*`, though that is not recommended.

[example]
.Figure containing a key / legend using `*Key*` syntax (from ISO Rice document)
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[alt text]
footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

*Key*

stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.
----
====


== Notes and footnotes

Notes and footnotes can be encoded as part of a figure. Both types are
rendered in the figure footer, below the Key.

To encode figure notes and footnotes:

* Notes (`NOTE: ...`) entered immediately a figure is considered to be a figure
note, and hence included in the figure.

* Footnotes (``footnote:````[...]``) part of the textual content of the figure
or notes are included in the figure.

.Example of a figure with a note and a footnote
====
[source,adoc]
----
.Amount of gelatinization of husked rice through time footnote:[at 1 Pa]
image::rice_images/rice_image10-1.png[]

[NOTE]
Husked rice gelatinized through the Verrol process.
----
====

[TIP]
====
Figure C.1 in the Metanorma ISO Rice example document illustrates a large range
of figure formatting options.
====


[[statement-units]]
== Statement concerning units

A statement concerning units used can be added to a figure, indicating the units
of measurement used in the figure.

NOTE: This currently applies to the ISO, IEC and BSI flavors, and flavors that
inherit from them.

The units statement is encoded as a NOTE of type `units` (`[NOTE,type=units]`).

The statement is rendered in the top-right corner of the
figure [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.3.6].

.Figure with a statement concerning units
====
[source,adoc]
----
.Amount of gelatinization of husked rice through time
image::rice_images/rice_image10-1.png[]

[NOTE,type=units]
Amount in grams; time in seconds.
----
====


== Subfigures

Subfigures are entered by including multiple images in an example block.

NOTE: Subfigures commonly appear in the ISO/IEC flavors.

[example]
.Figure with 3 subfigures (from ISO Rice document)
=====
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Stages of gelatinization
====
.Initial stages: No grains are fully gelatinized (ungelatinized starch granules are visible inside the kernels)
image::rice_images/rice_image3_1.png[]

.Intermediate stages: Some fully gelatinized kernels are visible
image::rice_images/rice_image3_2.png[]

.Final stages: All kernels are fully gelatinized
image::rice_images/rice_image3_3.png[]
====
--
=====


== Preformatted content

Figures can include preformatted content.

[example]
.Figure with a preformatted block
=====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[figure]
.Hexagram 46 "Ascending"
====
....
|===| |===|
|===| |===|
|===| |===|
|=========|
|=========|
|===| |===|
....
====
----
=====


For accessibility, preformatted blocks can be provided with an `alt` text
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

[example]
.Figure with preformatted block with alt text
=====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[figure]
====
[alt=ASCII art of a dog]
....
     ___^_
   /    | \__/\
    \   /  ^ ^|
   / \_/   0  0_
  /             \
 /     ___     0 |
/      /  \___ _/
....
====
----
=====


== Class

Figures in documents can belong to different classes (e.g. _Plate_, _Chart_,
_Diagram_), each of which can be auto-numbered and captioned differently.

To set this, the desired class can be indicated through the `class`
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.5].

.Figure with specific class
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[class=plate]
.Rice husk separation in rice farm at Breton near Dinan
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====


== Source

A figure block can incorporate an indication of its source.

To set this, the source is expected to be a bibliographical reference, just as
with term
sources [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.2].

.Figure with source
======
[source,asciidoc]

== Image mapping for SVG

Metanorma supports SVG as one of its image formats. SVG have the ability to hyperlink parts of the
image to other destinations, expressed as `<a href=...`.

An SVG image can name a particular destination for a hyperlink, which the user wants to update
to a different destination. If an image has been created independently of the current document, for example,
it may hyperlink to some arbitrary destinations, which the user wants to point instead to anchors
within the document they are authoring.

In order to support such mapping, Metanorma provides an `svgmap` 
function [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.3].
This involves wrapping the SVG image link in a figure block, given the role attribute `[.svgmap]`
instead of `[figure]`. The image link is followed by an unordered list of link mappings: the new
desired destination for the SVG hyperlink (expressed as either a cross-reference or a hyperlink),
then semicolon, then the original SVG link destination.

So in the following example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
 [.svgmap]
====
image::action_schemaexpg1.svg[]

* <<ref1,Computer>>; mn://action_schema
* http://www.example.org[]; http://www.example.com
* <<express:action_schema:action_schema.basic>>; 3
====
----

we have SVG file `action_schemaexpg1.svg`, and it contains hyperlinks to three destinations
`mn://action_schema`, `http://www.example.com`, and `3`. The block instructs Metanorma to rewrite
those hyperlink destinations in the SVG, expressed as `<a href=...`,
 to point to the location of the references on the left side: 

* `mn://action_schema` is rewritten to the location in the document of the `ref1` anchor 
(or bibliographic reference); the optional cross-reference text, `Computer`, is inserted in the SVG
hyperlink, replacing whatever text is already there, and can be used as a mouseover tip
* `http://www.example.com` is rewritten to `http://www.example.org`
* `3` is rewritten as the destination of the implicit cross-reference `<<express:action_schema:action_schema.basic>>`
