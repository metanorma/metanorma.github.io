= References and bibliography

== General

In standard documents typically there are two types of references, namely
the "`normative references`" and the "`bibliography`" (informative references).

Every bibliographic section must be preceded by the style attribute
`[bibliography]` so that references they contain may be recognized as such:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[id1,1]]] _First reference_
* [[[id2,2]]] _Second reference_
* [[[id3,3]]] _Third reference_
--

[example]
.Example of creating the "`Normative references`" clause in an ISO deliverable
====
In ISO, the "`Normative references`" clause is stated in
Clause 3 (ISO Directives Part 2, Clause 15), while the "`Bibliography`"
section is set as the last unnumbered section at the end of document
(ISO Directives Part 2, Clause 21). It should be typeset as the following:

[source,asciidoc]
----
...
// This is clause 3
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[ISO8601-1,ISO 8601-1:2019]]] _First normative reference_
* [[[ISO8601-2,ISO 8601-2:2019]]] _Second normative reference_

...

// This is the last section
[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ISO10241-1,ISO 10241-1]]] _First bibliographic reference_
...
----
====

Normative and informative references are normally recognised by the
distinct title given them, specific to the flavour; however, the normative
status of the bibliographic section can be given explicitly with
a `normative` boolean attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.7]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[bibliography,normative=true]
== References normative

...

[bibliography,normative=false]
== References informative
----

Bibliography sections can be split into subsections.
Metanorma AsciiDoc requires each subsection containing references
to be styled with `[bibliography]`, and raises an (ignorable)
warning if the subsections are contained in a section itself
styled with `[bibliography]`.

[example]
.Example of having multiple bibliography sub-sections
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Bibliography

[bibliography]
=== Part 1

* [[[id1,1]]] _First reference_
* [[[id2,2]]] _Second reference_
* [[[id3,3]]] _Third reference_

[bibliography]
=== Part 2

* [[[id4,4]]] _Fourth reference_
* [[[id5,5]]] _Fifth reference_
* [[[id6,6]]] _Sixth reference_
--
====

NOTE: A warning will be raised if `== Bibliography` in the above EXAMPLE was
preceded by `[bibliography]`.

[NOTE]
====
In Metanorma IETF, the bibliography sections "`Normative references`"
and "`Informative references`" are separate, where the
"`Informative references`" section is optional:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[id1,1]]], _First normative reference_
...

// Optional
[bibliography]
== Informative references

* [[[idn, n]]], _First informative reference_
...

--

See https://www.metanorma.org/author/ietf/topics/references/[References (AsciiRFC v3)]
for further details.
====

=== Numbering and ordering

All entries in a bibliography section, whether standards or generic,
are renumbered incrementally in the Metanorma XML. If the number for
generic references is updated, all citations of that reference will
be updated as well.

By default, Metanorma does not change the ordering of references in the
bibliography sections from what has been entered by the authors.
Some Metanorma flavours *will* reorder references to suit document
requirements.

That said, all references in a references section are grouped together,
even if there is intervening text in the source document. Only notes
are left attached to their reference, in order to enable annotated
bibliographies.

=== Predefined text

Any initial text in a Normative Reference section (before the first
reference) is replaced by predefined text specific to the Metanorma flavour.

In order to override this, initial text can be provided by the user
as a note of type "`boilerplate`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.9.2]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Normative references

[NOTE,type=boilerplate]
--
The following contract document is referred to in the text in such a
way that some or all of its content constitutes requirements of this
document.
--
----


== Entering typical references

=== General

Typical bibliographic entries are given as unordered lists.

A single bibliographic entry must be preceded by a
bibliographic anchor, in triple brackets, consisting of:

* an internal identifier (used within Metanorma AsciiDoc for cross-references); and
* a document identifier.

This is illustrated as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},{document identifier or reference tag}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

WARNING: See link:/author/topics/document-format/text#text-ref-allowed-anchors[Anchor ID syntax]
for allowed characters in anchor IDs.


=== Implied reference tags

Bibliographic entries for standards are expected to have the standard
document identifier as the item label. References to well-defined
standards codes use the document identifiers for citations
(e.g. `ISO 20483:2013`).

This is entered as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},{document identifier as reference tag}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

[example]
.Example of implied reference tags
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO20483,ISO 20483:2013]]], _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,ISO 6540:1980]]]. _Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
--

gets rendered as:

____
* ISO 20483:2013. _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* ISO 6540:1980. _Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
____
====

A well-defined standards code as the item label will by default result in the reference details for the
bibliographic entry being auto-fetched, provided that auto-fetching has been defined for that class of
standard (<<autofetch>>).


=== Numeric reference tags

Generic references in bibliographies, as opposed to standards
references, use numbers, which are rendered bracketed, like `[1]`.

This is entered as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},{number}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

[example]
.Example of specifying numeric reference tags
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO20483,1]]], _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,1]]]. _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
--

gets rendered as:

____
* [1] _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [2] _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
____
====

NOTE: To indicate usage of the numeric reference system, any number
can be entered into the reference tag field. All references are
automatically re-sorted and auto-incremented during compilation.

Normative references must use either standard document identifiers, or named reference tags.

NOTE: Numeric references cannot be used for entries in normative references, as bibliography numbering starts at 1.
Execution will abort if a numeric reference tag is found in normative references, in order to prevent
numbering confusion [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.4].


=== Named reference tags

==== General

References can be tagged with user-supplied alphanumeric labels,
in addition to numbers or standard document identifiers.

These are indicated by wrapping the label within the bibliographic
anchor in brackets.

==== Named reference tag with fully specified bibliographic entry

If the reference text is fully specified, and where no auto-fetching of
the bibliographic entry is necessary, a user-supplied label is entered
using the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},({reference tag})]]], _{reference list text}_
--

NOTE: These alphanumeric labels will not result in the bibliographic
entry being auto-fetched.

[example]
.Sample named reference tag with fully specified bibliographic entry
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO20483,(CerMoist)]]], _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,(MaiMoist)]]]. _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
--

gets rendered as:

____
* [CerMoist] _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [MaiMoist] _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
____
====


==== Named reference tag with automatic reference fetching

Users can provide both their own alphanumeric label, and the
well-defined reference identification code for the standards document.

This will result in the bibliographic entry being auto-fetched, so long
as that auto-fetch is supported for that class of references
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.15]:

If a named reference is to be auto-fetched, it is entered by prefixing
the named reference tag (in parentheses) to the document identifier:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[{anchor},({reference tag}){reference identification code}]]], _{reference list text}_
--

[example]
.Example of named reference tag fetched automatically
====
[source,adoc]
----
* [[[ISO20483,(CerMoist)ISO 20483]]], _ISO 20483:2013 Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,(MaiMoist)ISO 6540]]]. _ISO 6540:1980 Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
----
====

Rich-text formatting is supported within the named reference tag, including
footnotes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.3].

This is useful for cases where a cited reference is out-of-date but unsuitable
to be updated.

[example]
.Example of rich-text formatting in named reference tag
====
[source,adoc]
----
* [[[ISO9000,(ISO 9000:2005 footnote:[Superseded by ISO 9000:2015.])ISO 9000:2005]]]
----
====

WARNING: It is strongly advised not to use rich-text formatting within named
reference tags, as it can lead to unexpected results and problems with
copy-pasting.

== Alternate bibliography formats

=== Entering formatted citations

For generic references, by default, Metanorma only supports formatted citations,
which are given as such in the AsciiDoc source.

The NIST flavour of Metanorma currently supports rendering of generic references, on an experimental basis.

See link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup[Automatic reference lookup] topic.


=== Entering Relaton XML

Bibliographic entries can also be given as raw https://www.relaton.org[Relaton XML],
in an AsciiDoc passthrough block. Of course, any Relaton XML BibItem entries
need to be valid, and using correct `id` attributes:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative References

++++
<bibitem id="doc1">
<docidentifier>ISO 1</docidentifier>
<title>Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Standard reference temperature for the specification of geometrical and dimensional properties</title>
</bibitem>
++++
--

=== AsciiBib

Finally, bibliographic entries can be entered as AsciiDoc definition lists, capturing the structure
of Relaton XML. This approach is documented in https://www.relaton.org/specs/asciibib/[relaton.org].

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative References

[%bibitem]
=== Rubber latex -- Sampling
id:: iso123
docid::
  type::: ISO
  id::: ISO 123
docid::
  type::: ABC
  id::: 32784
type:: standard
--

The `id` attribute of bibitem clauses (the anchor of the clause) can be overridden by an AsciiDoc
anchor on the clause [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.1].
This can be required for AsciiDoc to process crossreferences correctly. Any such anchors must not be
preceded by `_`, as AsciiDoc uses that to indicate anchors it inserts automatically, which are not
supplied in the source.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative References

[[iso123]]
[%bibitem]
=== Rubber latex -- Sampling
id:: iso123
docid::
  type::: ISO
  id::: ISO 123
docid::
  type::: ABC
  id::: 32784
type:: standard
--


== Citations

=== General

Citations of references in Metanorma are formulated as cross-references; the ID cross-referenced is the
internal identifier given for the bibliographic entry (`ref1` in the examples above).

In typical AsciiDoc, any text in a cross-reference that follows a comma constitutes custom text for the cross-reference.
So a cross-reference `\<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>` will be rendered as
"`the foregoing reference`", and hyperlinked to the `ISO7301` reference.

[[localities]]
=== Localities

Citations can include details of where in the document the citation is located (or the word "`whole`");
these are entered by suffixing the lowercase type of locality, then an equals sign,
then the locality value or range of values.

Multiple instances of locality and reference can be provided, delimited by comma or colon.

* By default, these are interpreted as hierarchically refining a single location in a text,
through consecutive narrower localities +
+
[example]
====
"`Part IV, Chapter 3, paragraph 12`": `\<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>`
====

* Discontinuous localities can be named by repeating the same locality type +
+
[example]
====
"`page 4, page 7`": `\<<ref1,page=4,page=7>>`
====

* Discontinuous references can also be be specified by delimiting sequences of localities
with semicolon [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.24] +
+
[example]
====
"`Part IV, Chapter 3; Part VI, Chapter 9`": `\<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3;part=VI,chapter=9>>`
====

* More complex relation between discontinuous references can be specified by prefixing
`and!`, `or!`, `from!` and `to!` to sequences of localities separated by 
semicolon [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4],
as for link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs/#combined-xrefs[Combination of cross-references].
This will result in overt connectives between the references, which will be internationalised. +
+
[example]
====
"`Part IV, Chapter 3 or Part VI, Chapter 9`": `\<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3;or!part=VI,chapter=9>>`
====
+
[example]
====
"`Chapters 3 and 7`": `\<<chapter=3;and!chapter=7>>`
====

Any trailing text after the sequence of `locality=reference` (or `locality{space}reference`)
is treated as custom text for the cross-reference, as would occur normally in a
typical AsciiDoc cross-reference.

The locality can appear in quotations if it contains special characters (like dashes or commas).

[example]
.Example of referencing locality in Metanorma citations
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO7301,clause=3.1-3.4>>

NOTE: This table is based on <<ISO7301,table=1>>.

Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with <<xxx,section="5-3-1,bis">>
----
====

[example]

<<ISO712,the foregoing reference>>
----
====

[example]
.Example that renders the reference with (multiple) hierarchical localities
====
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Section 5, Page 8-10"

----
====

[example]
.Example of referencing locality with additional text
====
----

----
====

[example]
.Example of referencing with a "whole" locality
====
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Whole of text"
<<ISO712,whole>>
----
====

The references cannot contain spaces. Any text following the sequence of localities
will be displayed instead of the localities.

A custom locality can be entered by prefixing it with `locality:`.

[example]
.Example of referencing a custom locality the `locality:` prefix
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Frontispiece 5, Page 8-10"
<<ISO712,locality:frontispiece=5, page=8-10>>
----
====

Custom localities may not contain commas, colons, or space.
Localities with the `locality:` prefix are recognized in internationalization
configuration files.

Any text after the bibliographic localities is still treated as custom
cross-reference text.

[example]
.Example of referencing with bibliographic localities with additional custom text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO7301,clause=5,table=1,the foregoing reference>>
----
====


==== Anchors

Exceptionally, the `anchor` locality is only used in HTML, to generate
anchor links to other HTML pages [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

It is intended for use with bibliographic anchors linking to URLs (`repo()`):
see <<hyperlink-biblio>>.


[example]
.Example of using the `anchor` locality for rendering in HTML output
====
The following input:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=2,table=1a,page=7-9,anchor=xyz>>

...

* [[[ISO7301,path(./iso7301.html,ISO 7301)]]]
--

will render in HTML as:

[source,html]
--
<a href="./iso7301.html#xyz">ISO 7301, Clause 2, Table 1a, page 7-9</a>
--
====

=== Case and dropped locality labels

The `capital%`, `lowercase%` and `droploc%` options used for internal
cross-references can also be used as prefixes to localities, modifying how those
localities are
rendered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.9].

The following input:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<ISO7301,droploc%clause=2>>

<<ISO7301,lowercase%clause=2>>
--

will render as:

____
ISO 7301, 2

ISO 7301, clause 2
____


[[autofetch]]
== Automatic reference fetching ("auto-fetch")

=== Relaton databases

https://www.relaton.org/[Relaton] can fetch bibliographic entries
for any standards known to have online bibliographic databases.

Any bibliographic entry recognized through its document identifier prefix
will by default have its bibliographic entry fetched by the appropriate
Relaton extension.

The fetched data overrides any content about the item provided in the document,
since the online bibliography is treated as the source of truth for that
standards document.

The format of the standard identifier required for automatic lookup is documented at
link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup/[Automatic reference lookup].

NOTE: Currently Metanorma supports auto-fetching document identifiers
from: ISO, IEC, IETF, GB, NIST, OGC, CalConnect and many more.

[example]
.Example of specifying an auto-fetched reference
====
The following will trigger auto-fetching:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ref1,ISO 20483]]]
--

and gets rendered as:

____
ISO 20483:2013. _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
____
====

=== Other databases

Metanorma allows bibliographic entries to be specified for retrieval from arbitrary
databases [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

This is achieved with the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[anchor,repo:(repository-name/document-entry,document-identifier)]]]
--

This retrieves item `document-entry` from repository `repository-name`; the document
identifier "document-identifier" is retained in order for citations to remain well-formed.

Bibliographical information about the entry is *not* auto-fetched via Relaton.

By default, `repo:(repository-name/document-entry)` is left in the Metanorma XML as
a document identifier, of type `repo`; it will typically be resolved in post-processing.

[[hyperlink-biblio]]
=== HTML links

Metanorma allows bibliographic entries to be specified by either relative or absolute
hyperlink [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

This is achieved with the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[anchor,path:(hyperlink,document-identifier)]]]
--

As with `repo:()` bibliographic entries, the document
identifier `document-identifier` is retained in order for citations to remain well-formed.

Bibliographical information about the entry is *not* auto-fetched via Relaton. Instead,
if the hyperlink is local, Metanorma will look for an XML (Metanorma XML) or
RXL (Relaton XML) file at the nominated location with the same filename, and read in the
bibliographic metadata from there.

All citations of this entry in the document (referencing `anchor`) will be rendered with
the hyperlink in HTML.
