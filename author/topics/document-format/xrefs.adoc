= Cross-references

== General

Cross-references are realized in Metanorma AsciiDoc by assigning an anchor
to the block to be referenced, and writing a cross-reference containing
that anchor ID:

[source,adoc]
--
[[anchor-id]]
= Target clause

The requirements are...

= Reference clause

As seen in <<anchor-id>>...
--

WARNING: See <<text-ref-allowed-anchors>> for allowed characters in anchor IDs.

NOTE: Cross-reference text in Metanorma adheres to guidance given in
ISO/IEC DIR 2 for internal cross-references, in order to guarantee
unambiguous referencing.

In particular, if a formula, example, figure, list, list item or table is cross-referenced
outside its (sub)clause, the clause containing the item is always given in the cross-reference,
unless the item is being referenced in the same clause.

In the case of notes, the containing clause is extended to containing example, figure or table.

[example]
====
For example, in the Metanorma ISO Rice model sample document
formula B.1 is defined in Annex B.6, and is referenced in B.6 and B.7.

In the Rice model document published by ISO, both instances are cited as "`Formula (B.1)`".
However, Metanorma follows ISO/IEC DIR 2 in citing the former
as "`Formula (B.1)`", but the latter as "`B.6, Formula (B.1)`".

In this sense, Metanorma is "`more royalist than the king`" in applying formatting rules and
validationâ€”which is what you would want of a computer-based tool.
====

The label of the item cross-referenced, the use of brackets, and the containing reference
are all taken care of by Metanorma; the document author needs only give the item identifier
in the AsciiDoc source
(e.g. `\<<``formulaB-1``>>` generates either "`Formula (B.1)`" or "`B.6, Formula (B.1)`",
depending on where in the document it occurs.)

If the cross-reference is given with `droploc%` as its text, then the label and prefix
are dropped: the cross-reference value is given in
isolation [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.4].

This can be done for example for ranges:

[source,adoc]
----
Clauses <<context,droploc%>> to <<improvement,droploc%>>
----

to be rendered as e.g.

____
Clauses 7 to 9
____

[[combined-xrefs]]
== Combination of cross-references

It is also possible to combine multiple cross-references into a single expression, which will be
internationalised as appropriate [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4].
Multiple cross-references are separated by `;`. The connections recognised between cross-references 
are `and`, `or`, `from`, and `to`, and these are prefixed to the cross-reference anchor, separated by `!`:

[source,adoc]
----
<<context;to!improvement>>
----

rendered as

____
Clauses 7 to 9
____

[source,adoc]
----
<<context;and!improvement>>
----

rendered as

____
Clauses 7 and 9
____

Of the connectives, `from` and `to`
are presumed to nest more closely than `and` or `or`, and there is no provision for complex nesting.
If a connective is left out before `to`, `from` is presupposed; otherwise, `and` is presupposed.



[[text-ref-allowed-anchors]]
== Anchor ID syntax

Anchor IDs of any type (cross-references, items, bibliographies, etc.) are directly
converted into XML, and therefore *must not* contain the following:

* colons
* whitespaces or;
* words starting with numbers.

These cases are not supported in XML; permitted characters are specified by the
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#NT-NCName[NCName attribute for Namespace Declaration].

Colons in cross-references are used for
link:/author/topics/document-format/collections#indirect-xrefs[indirect cross-references between files in the same collection],
to delimit namespaces and containers from anchor IDs [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.4].

== Localities

Normally in AsciiDoc, any text in a cross-reference that follows a comma
constitutes custom text for the cross-reference.

So a cross-reference `\<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>`
would be rendered as "`the foregoing reference`", and hyperlinked to the
`ISO7301` reference.

In Metanorma AsciiDoc cross-references, bibliographic localities
(e.g. page numbers, clause numbers) can be added directly after the comma,
as part of the cross-reference text.

NOTE: This differs from the normal AsciiDoc treatment of custom text.

[example]
====
EXAMPLE: "`ISO 7301, Clause 2, Table 1a, pp. 7-9`" would be expressed as:

[source,adoc]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=2,table=1a,page=7-9>>
--
====

See link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography#localities[localities and locality values].

== List items

List items can be cross-referenced by inserting a bookmark at the very start of
the list item:

[source,adoc]
--
. Ordered list
.. [[id1]] This is the first list item
... [[id2]] This is a list sub-item
--

== Definition List Terms

Definition list terms can be cross-referenced by inserting a bookmark at the
very start
of the term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.0]:

[source,adoc]
--
[[id1]]Term 1:: Definition
[[id2]]Term 2::: Another Definition
--

== Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks to URIs can have alt text, which is used in accessibility
(corresponding to the HTML `a@title` attribute).

This is specified by appending `,title=...` after the text in the URL macro in
Metanorma AsciiDoc:

[example]
====
[source,adoc]
--
http://www.example.com[text to go into the hyperlink]

http://www.example2.com[text to go into the second hyperlink,title=This is a tooltip for the link]
--
====

== External references

In link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography#localities[localities and locality values],
anchor can be integrated in citations of documents via references.

For example:

[source,adoc]
--
<<ISO7301,anchor=xyz>>
--

will generate a hyperlink to the element with ID `xyz` in document `ISO7301`.
This convention is necessary for cross-references between documents in a
Metanorma document collection.

Outside of that, Metanorma will process cross-references to anchors within
external documents just like typical AsciiDoc.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
--
<<document1.adoc#b>>
--

will be processed as a link to anchor `#b` in document `document1.adoc`.

If the reference uses the `.adoc` suffix, as in the example above, it is stripped in Metanorma XML
and substituted with the extension of the current document type during document generation.

The above example is rendered in Metanorma XML as `<xref target="document1#b">`,
in HTML as `<a href="document1.html#b">`, and in PDF as `<a href="document1.pdf#b">`.
