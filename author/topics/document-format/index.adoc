= Indexes and table of contents

== Index terms

=== General

Metanorma supports index entries with primary, secondary and tertiary
index terms. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

Primary index terms are listed under the first-level index,
the secondary index terms are listed under the primary index terms' sub-index,
and the tertiary index terms are listed under the secondary index term's sub-index.

Index term behavior differs per rendered output format:

* In PDF, indexes are rendered as references to page numbers.
* In HTML and DOC, indexes are rendered as references to the nearest
  labelled block; a note, example, figure, formula etc., if the index
  term is contained within it, or a clause or subclause, otherwise.

Index term links are only rendered in certain flavours, and do not
appear otherwise in DOC, PDF or HTML output.

NOTE: Currently, only the ISO, IETF and BIPM flavours render
index terms.


=== Rendered index term syntax

Metanorma index entries are entered through two different
syntaxes. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

Rendered index term: `+((Term))+`

* Produces the output "`Term`"; and
* Links to the primary index term of the same name, "`Term`".

Hidden index term: `+(((IndexTerm1)))+`,
  `+(((IndexTerm1, IndexTerm2)))+` or
  `+(((IndexTerm1, IndexTerm2, IndexTerm3)))+`

* Produces no output; and
* Links to the primary index term `IndexTerm1`. And if provided, links to
  the secondary nesting, `IndexTerm2` and the tertiary nesting `IndexTerm3`.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
--
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)),
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))).
--


=== Rich-text formatting in index terms

Rich-text formatting in index terms is
supported [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

[source,adoc]
--
signifying by divine providence that I, ((*Arthur*)),
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword~E~, stem:[sqrt(E)], Excalibur))).
--

NOTE: Formatting of index terms is ignored in IETF rendering.


=== Entry ranges

Metanorma supports index entries that involve
ranges [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0],
using the command `index-range:to[...]`.

The command itself accepts an AsciiDoc index entry, such as
`+((...))+` or `+(((...)))+`.

The index entry range starts at the location of the `index-range`
command, in the same way as the index command it contains; the end of
the range is the element with the anchor `to`, and that is expected
to be provided as a bookmark.

[source,adoc]
--
signifying by divine providence that I, index-range:end-range-1[((*Arthur*))],
was to carry Excalibur index-range:end-range-2[(((Sword~A~, stem:[sqrt(2)], Excalibur)))].

...

and so forth.[[end-range-1]]

...

_Sic explicit fabula._[[end-range-2]]
--

The preceding example has a visible index entry for _**Arthur**_,
ranging from the location of `+*Arthur*+` up to `end-range-1`, and
a hidden index entry for _Sword~A~_, ranging from the location of
`+Sword~A~+` up to `end-range-2`.


=== Cross-references

Metanorma also supports "`see`" and "`see also`" cross-references between
index terms [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.5],
using the `index` command.

The command takes at least two parameters:

* the primary index term to be cross-referenced;
* the target of the cross-reference;
* optionally, the secondary and tertiary index term to be cross-referenced.

[source,adoc]
--
index:see[Satchmo,Louis Armstrong]
index:see[James Brown,influences,Hank Ballard and the Midnighters]
index:also[guitar,electric,technique,Jimi Hendrix]
--

Rendered as:

____
* Satchmo, _see_ Louis Armstrong
* James Brown
** influences, _see_ Hank Ballard and the Midnighters
* guitar
** electric
*** technique, _see also_ Jimi Hendrix
____

=== Index placement

If any index terms are present in a document, and the current flavour supports
indexes, then an index section will be automatically generated and appended to
the end of the document.

To override the title of the index section, or indicate where it should be
placed, use the index section markup shown below.

[source,adoc]
--
[index]
== Index
--

Any index will be appended after any content you may choose to place in the
index section, but indexes typically appear with no preface.


[[auto-index-terms]]
=== Automated index terms

If the document attribute `:index-terms:` is used, all terms (and symbols) are
indexed automatically in postprocessing.

The document does not need to include explicit index terms for
them [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.3].

== Table of contents

=== General

A table of contents is provided at the start of a Metanorma document rendering,
either as:

* prefatory material in electronic document formats (PDF, Word); or
* a sidebar in the HTML output.

This table is typically a listing of all clauses of the document, and runs two
levels deep.

In some flavours, a separate table of contents is inserted for figures, tables,
and recommendations.

=== Using the `toc` command to generate a ToC

A manual table of contents command has been added to
Metanorma [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.5].

This is intended for a local table of contents, e.g., at the start of an
appendix.

The table of contents `toc` command is utilized as follows.

[source,adoc]
----
toc:["xpath1:depth1","xpath2:depth2","xpath3:depth3"...]
----

Where,

* `depth` is a number indicating the depth of indentation of the ToC
entry (default value `1`)

* `xpath` is the XPath of the title being indexed in the Metanorma XML.

For instance, in the following command:

[source,adoc]
----
toc:["//clause[@id = 'clause1'\]/clause/title","//clause[@id = 'clause1'\]/clause/clause/title:2"]
----

* all titles of subclauses of the clause with ID `clause1` are at the first
  depth level of the manual table of contents (defaults to depth `1`)

* all titles of sub-subclauses of the clause with ID `clause1` are at the second
  depth level of the manual table of contents

This means that the table of contents will have of the first-level clause with
ID `clause1`, running three levels deep.


=== Manually specifying a ToC

A manual table of contents can also be provided as a clause of type
`toc` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.7]
without using the `toc` command.

Any table of contents entries within that manual table of contents are expected
to be provided as cross-references within unordered lists.

The table of contents can contain subclauses, each with its own list of
cross-references, and other text.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
[type=toc]
=== Table of contents

This is a table of contents.

==== First subsection

* <<xref1>>
* <<xref2,This is a modified title>>

==== Second subsection

* <<xref3>>
* <<xref4>>
----


=== Variant titles

Clauses in Metanorma normally have only one title, and that title is used to
identify the clause in the table of contents.

However, a manually created table of contents can make use of variant titles
instead.

Variant titles [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.5] are entered
as paragraphs with a `variant-title` role attribute within a clause, as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
=== Proper title

[.variant-title,type=toc]
This is the variant title

Text of section.
----

Variant titles are not rendered in the body of the text. However, any variant
titles of type `toc` are used instead of the title as the entry text for a
manual table of contents.

NOTE: Of course, if an explicit cross-reference text is given in a `toc` clause,
that takes priority.

Variant titles are also used to generate the automated all-of-document table of
contents for HTML and PDF
documents [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.8.5].
They are not used in Word DOC output, because tables of contents for Word
documents are generated dynamically from the current heading.

Variant titles are not currently used to generate the tables of other entities.
