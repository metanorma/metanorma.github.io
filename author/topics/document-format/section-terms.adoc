== Concepts, designations, terms and definitions

=== General

In many standards organizations, a dedicated "Terms and definitions" section is
included in their documents in order to provide a local dictionary containing
definitions for terms used within a document.

This dictionary can be considered a "concept collection" or a "concept
dictionary".

Some organizations allow the specification of more than one "terms and
definitions" section, for example, in order to separate normative and
informative concepts.

There are multiple possibilities when managing these concepts:

* all concepts are defined locally in the document;

* some concepts are locally defined while some are externally sourced

* all concepts are sourced from one or more external entries
  (e.g. a termbase, a document)

Working with a concept collection within Metanorma requires understanding
the following topics that are explained below:

. How to work with a concept collection;

. How to work with individual concepts.


=== Working with a concept collection

==== Basics

To create a concept collection, commonly understood as a "terms and definitions
section" within Metanorma, all you need is to apply the correct title for a
section heading. Metanorma will be able to insert that in the correct location
in the resulting document.

Take ISO for example, its "`Terms and definitions`" clause is always at
Clause 3 according to the ISO DIR 2.
Regardless where the "Terms and definitions" clause is defined, it will always
be rendered at Clause 3.

.Creating a terms and definitions clause in Metanorma ISO
[example]
====

--

renders as

____
*3. Terms and definitions*

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in
standardization at the following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at http://www.iso.org/obp[]
* IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org[]
____
====

Notice that in Metanorma ISO, there is predefined text that is automatically
generated, not entered by the user. This is also the case for many standards
bodies that specify rules for document structure.


==== Clause title

A terms and definitions clause will be recognized if either title below is given
regardless of case:

* _Terms and definitions_;
* _Terms, definitions and symbols_;
* _Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms_; or
* _Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms_

NOTE: This behavior differs across standard flavors; please refer to specific
documentation for a particular flavor.

[[source]]
==== Concept source

If the concepts of a standard are partly or fully sourced from an external
document or collection, that external item is cited in a `source` attribute
to the section.

The syntax to apply one or more concept sources is as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
[source=REFERENCE_ANCHOR]
== Terms and definitions
----

Where the `REFERENCE_ANCHOR` is the reference anchor of the cited item.
The definition of this cited reference item is typically entered under the
"Normative references" clause.

NOTE: The `source` attribute needs to be applied to the top-level clause, if
there are subclauses.

Any predefined text of the terms and definitions section is adjusted
accordingly.

.Setting ISO 712 as a terminology source for the concepts collection
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[source=ISO712]
== Terms and Definitions
--

renders as

image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-boilerplate-single-source.png[Illustration of predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with a single source ("ISO 712")]
====


Multiple sources are allowed. The sources are to be quoted into a single value,
and delimited by commas.

image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-boilerplate-multiple-sources.png[Illustration of predefined text of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with two sources]
====

==== Predefined text / Boilerplate

===== Appending to predefined text

The "`terms and definitions`" clause is often prefixed with _predefined text_
automatically before any terms are listed.

Such predefined text typically serve the following purposes:

* indicate provenance of definitions (see <<source>>); and
* provide the location where definitions may be consulted,
  depending on the flavour.

[example]
For ISO documents, a reference to the ISO Online Browsing Platform and to the
IEC Electropedia is provided in the predefined text.

Any paragraphs or lists in the input before the first term
are appended to the flavour's defined predefined text, in the
intermediate XML format [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

NOTE: Behavior prior to release `metanorma-standoc` 1.7.0 was for any such text
to be overwritten by the flavour's defined predefined text.

In the following example the Metanorma ISO flavor is used to demonstrate the
behavior.

Input:

[example]
.Appended predefined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

This is some random text I have inserted in this document.

* It does not follow ISO requirements
* Nor does it follow IEC requirements

=== Term 1
--

In the rendering, the text between the title and the first
term definition is appended to the predefined text required by ISO:

____
*3. Terms and definitions*

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in
standardization at the following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at http://www.iso.org/obp[]
* IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org[]

This is some random text I have inserted in this document.

* It does not follow ISO requirements
* Nor does it follow IEC requirements

*3.1 Term 1*
____
====


===== Overriding predefined text

If there are no terms and definitions from the document,
no terms should be included in the clause body (it should be blank).
The predefined text at the start of the clause is adjusted to
reflect both possibilities.

In order to replace (override) the predefined text with custom
content, an initial subclause with the style attribute
`[.boilerplate]` can be used to do
so [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

Input:

[example]
.Overridden predefined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
=== My predefined text (<<<=== this will be stripped)

This is predefined text that overwrites the default.

* No, it does not follow ISO requirements
* And no, it does not follow IEC requirements either

=== Term 1
--

Where:

* The title of the predefined text clause will be stripped (so you could equally
  use `=== {blank}`);

* The custom predefined text is encoded as a subclause, so that
  its extent can be made unambiguous in initial processing.

The example above will be rendered as:

.Rendering of overriden predefined text
____
*3. Terms and definitions*

This is predefined text that overwrites the default.

* No, it does not follow ISO requirements
* And no, it does not follow IEC requirements either

*3.1 Term 1*
____
====


===== Emptying predefined text

If you want to prevent the default predefined text from
appearing, you can do so by providing an empty
predefined text subclause.

[example]
.Emptying predefined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
=== {blank}

=== Term 1
--
====

==== Subclauses

===== Concept grouping subclauses

Any clause within a "`Terms and definitions`" section which is a non-terminal
subclause (has child nodes) is automatically considered a terms (or definitions)
section.

On the other hand, any descendant of a `nonterm` clause is also a `nonterm`
clause.

Informative clauses are indicated with the attribute `[obligation=informative]`;
clauses are normative by default.

===== Introductory non-term clause

All terminal subclauses of a term section (i.e. clauses that have no subclauses
of their own) are treated as term definitions.

We have already seen one exception to this, in `[.boilerplate]` clauses. More
generally, an introductory section can be treated as a subclause instead of a
term (and will retain its status as a subclause), by prefixing it with the style
attribute `[.nonterm]`:

[example]
.Providing an introductory non-term clause
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Terms from ISO 10303-1

For the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, the following terms
from ISO 10303-1 apply:

* integrated resource

[.nonterm]
=== Terms from ISO 10303-11

For the purposes of this document, the following terms from
ISO 10303-11 apply.

* entity;
* entity data type;
--

.Inclusion of non-term subclauses using the `[.nonterm]` attribute
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-non-clause-section.png[Inclusion of non-term subclauses]
====


The `[.nonterm]` attribute must only be used in subclauses that do
not contain any terms underneath (like the example above).
Otherwise, these terms will not be processed following the
corresponding formatting rules.

.Non-term attribute wrongly applied to a term-containing subclause
[example]
======
If the `[.nonterm]` attribute is applied to a term-containing subclause, the
wrong rendering will occur:

[.nonterm]
=== Terms from ISO 10303-1

For the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, the following terms
from ISO 10303-1 apply:

==== actual function range

the function which are related to some tuple of inputs
----

.Incorrect rendering of a term subclause due to wrong application of `[.nonterm]`
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-clause-incorrect.png[Incorrect rendering of a term subclause]

Therefore the `[.nonterm]` attribute must be removed:

======


=== Working with individual concepts

==== General

Concepts entered within "`terms and definitions`" sections follow a strict data
input scheme:

* The term is given as a *subheading* at the appropriate level
  (three equal signs, unless there are subsections in the "`Terms and definition`"
  section).
* The term is optionally followed by *alternative/admitted terms*,
  which must be marked up in an `+alt:[...]+` command;
  *deprecated terms*, which must be marked up in a `+deprecated:[...]+` command;
  and a term *domain*, which must be marked up in a `+domain:[...]+` command.

* The *definition* of the term is given in a separate paragraph.

* The definition is optionally followed by *examples*
  (paragraphs with an `[example]` style attribute).

* The definition is then optionally followed by *notes* (denoted with a `NOTE:`
  prefix).

* The definition is then followed by a *citation* for the term
  (marked with a `[.source]` role attribute).

* The *source* is a citation cross-reference to a normative reference,
  optionally followed by a comma and a modification if applicable.
  If the comma is appended without text, then the term will be shown as
  modified, with no specific modification.

NOTE: A term can be cross-referenced from other terms, through the smart terms
reference mechanism or by assigning an *anchor*.

More complex concepts can also be specified, with alternative terms,
deprecated terms, domain, examples and a definition modified
from its original source.

====


==== Domain and subject

Domain and subject apply to concepts as described in ISO 10241-1.

Concepts can be provided with extended metadata in a definition list,
after the term subheading, marked with the option attribute
`[%metadata]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

The following keys are allowed:

`domain`:: The domain of the term
`subject`:: The subject of the term

[example]

----
== Terms and definitions
=== Term 1

[%metadata]

subject:: pipes
----
====

==== Designations

===== General

A *designation* is the cover term for names of concepts that are included in
terms.

It covers:

* the _preferred_ name (displayed as the heading for the term);
* the _alternative_ or _admitted_ names (specified as `admitted:[...]` or `alt:[...]`), and
* the _deprecated_ names (specified as `deprecated:[...]`).


===== Preferred designations

The first preferred designation is specified as a section heading under
the "`Terms and definitions`" clause.

[example]
.A single preferred designation
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== application

one or more processes creating or using product data
----
====

Metanorma allows specifying multiple preferred
designations [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

Each designation in Metanorma AsciiDoc must appear in its own paragraph.

NOTE: Some standards bodies do not allow multiple preferred designations.

The `preferred:[...]` command can be used to specify additional designations for
the second and subsequent designations.

By default, they will be rendered in the same term title as the first preferred
designation, delimited by semicolons.

[example]
.Applying multiple preferred designations
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== application
preferred:[app]

one or more processes creating or using product data
----
====


===== Admitted designations

Admitted designations, also called alternative designations, are entered using
the command `admitted:[...]` (or `alt:[...]`).

[example]
.Example from ISO 10303-2
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== application interpreted model
admitted:[AIM]

information model that includes the application constructs necessary to satisfy
the requirements of an application reference model
----
====

===== Deprecated designations

Deprecated designations are entered using the `deprecated:[...]` command.

[example]
.Example from ISO 10303-2
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== business object model
deprecated:[BO Model]

single integrated information model for the scope of an AP
----
====


===== Designation metadata

Metadata about designations can be given in a definition list,
_immediately after the definition of the designation_
(including the term subheading), marked with option attribute
`[%metadata]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

The following keys are supported:

`language`:: the language of the designation. Specified as an ISO 639-* code.

`script`:: the script of the designation. Specified as an ISO 15924 code.

`field-of-application`:: text indicating the field of application of the designation (typically the domain),
and used to disambiguate from other designations identical in the current language.
The "field of application" in ISO/IEC appears in angle brackets, after the designation
itself [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.2].
+
--
[example]
.IEV 102-05-28 designation (from ISO/IEC DIR IEC SUP:2021 SK.5)
====
Laplacian, <of a scalar field>
====

[example]
.IEV 102-03-22 designation
====
component, <of a vector quantity>
====

NOTE: The "`field of application`" refers to the IEC terminology attribute of
"`specific use`", which contrasts against the ISO use of "`domain`".
While they are similar in subtle ways, the "`domain`" applies to a concept, where
"`specific use`" applies to a designation.
The concept "specific use" is used in IEC, heavily within IEV (the IEC 60050
series); it is not used in ISO.

NOTE: Refer to https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/[ISO/IEC Directives, IEC Supplement:2021], Annex SK "Rules for terminology work",
for more information on "`specific use`". Further details are also available in ISO 10241-1.
--

`usage-info`:: usage information, which is text used to disambiguate the
designation from other designations identical in the current language,
but not relating to the field of application of the designation. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.2].
+

NOTE: Refer to https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/[ISO/IEC Directives, IEC Supplement:2021], Annex SK "Rules for terminology work",
on the usage of "`usage information`". Further details can be found in ISO 10241-1.
--

`geographic-area`:: the geographic area of the designation. Specified as an ISO 3166-1 code.

`type`:: type of expression used as designation; supported values are

*** `prefix`
*** `suffix`
*** `abbreviation`
*** `full`

`isInternational`:: designation is valid across languages and country; value is
boolean

`abbreviation-type`:: type of abbreviation used; supported values are:

*** `truncation`
*** `acronym`
*** `initialism`

`pronunciation`:: guide to pronunciation for designation; accepts a string value

`absent`:: the designation is absent; value is boolean

`letter-symbol`:: the designation is not a linguistic expression, but a letter or
symbol; value is boolean


Grammar of the designation is encoded as keys within the tag `grammar`:

`grammar`::

`gender`::: the gender of the designation. Multiple values are allowed, comma
delimited. Supported values are:

* `masculine`
* `feminine`
* `neuter`
* `common`.

`isPreposition`::: the designation is a preposition; value is boolean

`isParticiple`::: the designation is a participle; value is boolean

`isAdjective`::: the designation is an adjective; value is boolean

`isVerb`::: the designation is a verb; value is boolean

`isAdverb`::: the designation is an adverb; value is boolean

`isNoun`::: the designation is a noun; value is boolean

`grammar-value`::: other miscellaneous grammatical information

[example]

----
====

The metadata for a term, discussed immediately above, is given in the same
definition list as the metadata about the first preferred designation, which is
given in the term header.

===== Empty designations

A designation can be empty:

[example]

----
====

NOTE: The "empty designation" is explicitly supported by ISO 10241-1.

===== Non-verbal designations / representations

A figure or formula can be used instead of a verbal expression, provided it
immediately follows a blank designation, before any metadata definition list.

[example]
.Providing one or more non-verbal designations

----
====

NOTE: Multiple non-verbal designations are supported by ISO 10241-1.


==== Definitions

===== Multiple definitions

A term may have multiple definitions, where each definition could have its own
source.

Metanorma allows the encoding of this more complex structure through embedding
each distinct definition within an open block, with a `[.definition]` role
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6].

[example]
.Multiple definitions for one designation
====
[source,adoc]
----

<<ISO2382,clause 2121372>>
--

[.definition]
--

[.source]
<<ISO2382,clause 2121373>>
--
----

Multiple definitions are rendered in Metanorma as an ordered list of
definitions:

. device performing an unspecified function [SOURCE: ISO 2382, 2121372]
. general metasyntactic variable [SOURCE: ISO 2382, 2121373]
____
====


===== Non-verbal representation of definitions

This notation can also be used to incorporate non-verbal representations of terms,
including tables, formulas, and figures, which can be given after or instead of
a verbal definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].
A non-verbal representation is identifierd as a definition instance that consists of
only tables, formulas, and/or figures. A definition that includes tables, formulas, and/or figures
as a single definition is still considered a verbal definition.

Verbal definitions and non-verbal representations can be given term sources
separately:

=====


==== Sourcing individual concepts

===== General

By default, term sources are considered authoritative, and are of either
`identical` or `modified` status, depending on whether modification text is
provided after a citation.


===== Modifying sourced concepts

A trailing comma after the source reference can indicate that the
term or definition was "`modified`", but with no further detail:

[example]
.Indicating a modified definition without further qualification
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]

--

renders as

.Example of a single source tagged as "`modified`".
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-single-source.png[Example of a single source tagged as modified]
====

A term and definition can be sourced from multiple sources (in accordance with
ISO 10241-1). In this case each source should be entered in a separate
`[.source]` paragraph.

[example]
.A term and definition originating from multiple sources
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,

[.source]
<<ISO7302,section 3.10>>,
--
====


===== Sourcing concepts from termbases

The requirement that the source of a term be given in a citation also applies
when the source is a termbase, such as the
http://www.electropedia.org[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)].

As with other information source types, the termbase must be first defined
in a references section.

The IEV is handled specially in Metanorma due to its frequency of use and
usage of a specific citation practice as advised by the IEC.

Metanorma requires all IEV references to be to a single reference, named "IEV".

In order to source an IEV term, you would need to:

. Add the "IEV" entry to your reference section using an anchor of your choice;
+
[example]
====
This example adds the "IEV" termbase with a chosen anchor `ievtermbank`.

[source,adoc]
----
* [[[ievtermbank,IEV]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
----
====

. Add the `[.source]` block at the end of the terminology entry.
+
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>
--
====

Formally, in accordance with IEC/TC 1 advised practice, IEV references should be
cited as `IEC 60050-nnn:yyyy`, where `n` is the top-level clause, and `yyyy` is
the year when that particular specification was published.

Metanorma automatically converts citations of IEV to citations of the
appropriate IEC 60050 standards according to the correct practice. The "IEV"
entry will be replaced by the appropriate IEC 60050 series references in all
outputs, including the canonical XML.

[example]
====
The following source:

[source,adoc]
----
<<ievtermbank,clause=113-01-07>>
----

will be rendered as:

____
IEC 60050-113:2011, 113-01-07
____
====

NOTE: Do not insert instances of IEC 60050 references for IEV citations; they
will be duplicated by the automatically generated references.

If a terminology entry is sourced from the IEV, Metanorma automatically performs
validation of the sourced entry to detect any modifications.
For IEV entries to be validated, the IEV reference must be given as a `clause`,
and in quotes (otherwise the locality syntax would be interpreted as a range).

[example]
A terminology entry that sources IEV 103-01-02 would use something like
`\<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>`.

A complete example is given below.

[example]
.Definition of "functional" sourced from the IEV
====
[source,asciidoc]
--

===== Citing terminological entries with numeric identifiers

In ISO and IEC, terminological entries are technically identified by
"identifiers", not "clauses", even though they may be similar in format.

In some cases,
like link:https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:2382:ed-1:v1:en[ISO/IEC 2382],
terminological clauses are numbered as plain numbers
without character separators (dashes or periods).

However, when the location is cited as a number, Metanorma will consider
the location a top-level clause, which will be represented in the
ISO style "`Clause X`", instead of the desired "`X`".

In this case, we will have to apply additional markup to indicate
the number is not a top-level clause using the `droploc%` flag.

===== Complex source attributes

Concept sources can be further qualified other than the simple `identical` or
`modified` statuses by adding explicit `status` and `type`
attributes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

The following attributes are supported for a concept source entry.

`status`::
`identical`::: The managed term in the present context is identical to the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`modified`::: The managed term in the present context has been modified from the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`restyled`::: The managed term in the present context has been restyled from the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`context-added`::: The managed term in the present context has had context added to it, relative to the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`generalisation`::: The managed term in the present context is a generalisation of the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`specialisation`::: The managed term in the present context is a specialisation of the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`unspecified`::: The managed term in the present context is in an unspecified relation to the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`type`::

`authoritative`::: The managed term is authoritative in the present context.

`lineage`::: The managed term constitutes lineage in the present context.

Term sources may apply designations instead of the entire term. This is done by
placing the term source after the designation, and any metadata definition list
describing the designation.

Term sources applying to the entire term are placed at the end of the term

==== Rich-text within term commands

The commands `+alt:[...]+`, `+deprecated:[...]+` and `+domain:[...]+`
can contain their own markup.

[example]

==== Stem expressions

AsciiDoc does not permit macros to be nested inside other macros.

Therefore the following markup which introduces a stem expression
as an admitted term, is considered illegal.

NOTE: The use of stem expressions as preferred terms is not a problem,
because the macro appears as a header.

[example]

====
[source,asciidoc]
--
=== stem:[t_90]
alt:[stem:[t_A]]

However, Metanorma will treat any standalone paragraph in a term section,
consisting of just a stem macro, as an admitted term:

[[citeterms]]
=== Referencing concepts

==== General

Instances of terms, symbols or abbreviations used in the document can be marked
up to indicate the semantic meaning of the concept. [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.14].

This can be done whether the concept is defined:

* in the current document;
* in an external, cited document; or
* in an external termbase.

Marking up mentions of concepts (terms, symbols, or abbreviations) in the
content body generally does not impact their rendering.

This tagging is intended for semantic processing of standards documents in
Metanorma Semantic XML.

Marking up term instances in the "`terms and definitions`" clauses may cause
terms to render differently in certain flavors, such as for ISO and IEC, in
order to display location of where those concepts are defined.

NOTE: The syntax for citing terms has been changed for v1.10.0.
This section describes the current syntax
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.0].

The generic syntax is shown here.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}
----

In this full form of the syntax, only the `term` argument is mandatory.

All of the following variants below are supported:

[source,adoc]
----
{{term}}                // or synonym: term:[term]
// Used if the concept is defined in the current document.

{{term,display-text}}   // or synonym: term:[term,display-text]
// Used if the concept is defined in the current document, and the desired
// display text differs from the concept term.

{{term,display-text,cross-reference}}
{{term,display-text,cross-reference,options="..."}}

{{<<identifier>>,term}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}
----

* `identifier`: an identifier for the term being cited (optional).

* `term`: the term cited, in its canonical form (mandatory).

* `display-text`: text to be displayed, if it is distinct from the cited term
(optional). If this argument is not provided, the canonical form and the display
text are assumed to be identical.

* `cross-reference-text`: text to display for the cross-reference to the concept
definition (optional). If this argument is not provided, the default rendering
of the cross-reference for the current Metanorma flavour is provided.

* `options`: options that determine how the concept is to be displayed (may be
flavour-specific).

NOTE: The `{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference,options=".."}}`
markup closely mirrors the markup syntax of cross-references in Metanorma
AsciiDoc (`\<<anchor,%option,text>>`).

Instances of cited terms are converted into a distinct `concept` element in
Metanorma Semantic XML, which includes a cross-reference to the term definition,
the canonical form of the term name, and the text to be displayed for the term
in that instance.


==== Concepts defined within current document

===== Reference by term

To cite a concept defined within a document the following syntax can be used.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
// The term is from the current document as a concept.
{{term}}
// or synonym:
term:[term]

// If the desired display text differs from the concept term.
{{term,display-text}}
// or synonym:
term:[term,display-text]

// If a specific version of the cross-reference text is required.
{{term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

`term` in concept syntax is matched against any of the preferred terms
in the document, but the wording of `term` is expected to be an exact match.

NOTE: Metanorma automatically creates anchor references for every concept
from the document, which is used when referencing by term.

[example]
.Example from ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 (2020), 16.5.10
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== terminological data
....

=== concept
...

=== terminological entry

part of a terminological data collection which contains the
{{terminological data}} related to one {{concept}}

// equivalent:
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
term:[terminological data] related to one term:[concept]
----

This will be displayed according to the flavour; the rendering typically
contains the term text, and a cross-reference to its definition. Any
hyperlinking is done on the cross-reference.

The default Metanorma rendering would look like:

____
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
_terminological data_ [term defined in Clause 3.1] related to one
_concept_ [term defined in Clause 3.2]
____

In the ISO flavour of Metanorma, and flavours derived from it, the rendering
follows ISO conventions:

____
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
_terminological data_ (3.1) related to one _concept_ (3.2)
____
====


In some cases, the displayed term is a variant of the referenced term, such as
its plural form. That means that the display text needs to be differentiated
from the referenced term.

.Example from ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
===== instant
...

===== time axis
...

===== time scale

system of ordered marks which can be attributed to {{instant, instants}} on the
{{time axis}}, one instant being chosen as the origin

// equivalent:

system of ordered marks which can be attributed to term:[instant, instants] on
the term:[time axis], one instant being chosen as the origin
----

In the rendering, the display text is used instead of the referenced term:

.Rendering of ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5
____
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to _instants_ (3.7) on
the _time axis_ (3.9), one instant being chosen as the origin
____
====

It is conceivable that authors will want to override the automatically-generated
cross-reference text with their own text, as is already possible for
cross-references within Metanorma.

This requires an expanded version of the expression:

[source,adoc]
----
===== instant
...

===== time axis
...

===== time scale

system of ordered marks which can be attributed to {{instant, instants}} on the
{{time axis,time axis,see the preceding discussion}}, one instant being chosen
as the origin
----

Renders into:

.Rendering of ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5 with custom text
____
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to _instants_ (3.7) on the
_time axis_ (see the preceding discussion), one instant being chosen as the
origin
____


[NOTE]
--
The terms reference capability relies on automatically created anchor
references for every term defined.

For example, in the following text,

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions
=== Foo

bar

=== Lor

special kind of term:[foo]
----

the anchors `\[[term-foo]]` and `\[[term-lor]]` are automatically created and
assigned to the terms 'foo` and `lor`.

These anchors are generated from the terms themselves according to these rules:

* the terms are lowercased;
* non-ASCII characters are stripped;
* whitespaces are replaced by `-`.

This means if you wanted to refer to a particular term from body text, you could
either:

* directly refer to the term: e.g., `see definition of term:[foo]`
* refer to the anchor of the term: e.g., `the topic is further explained in \<<term-foo>>`

In case you have created manual anchors that conflict with `[[term-{X}]]`, the
term reference mechanism is smart enough to rename the generated anchor as
`[[term-{X}-{n}]]`, where `n` is a number from 1, and so forth.

Therefore this will still work as expected:

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions
=== Foo
bar

=== Lor
special kind of term:[foo]

[[term-foo]]
== My section

lorem
----
--

===== Reference by symbol

Symbols and abbreviated terms defined in the document can also be cited as
concepts [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1].

In the case of symbols and abbreviated terms, the `symbol:[]` macro is used
instead of `term:[]`, and targets a symbol defined in a definition list within
the "`Symbols and abbreviated terms`" section.

NOTE: Such symbols have automatic anchors assigned to them, as with terms, but
prefixed with `symbol-` rather than `term-`. If the `{{...}}` format is used
instead, either a term or a symbol is matched; terms are matched by default.

[example]
.Citing concepts in content body do not get rendered
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Symbols and abbreviated terms

ISO:: International Standards Organization // automatically assigned the anchor `symbol-ISO`
[[xyz]]IEC:: International Electrotechnical Commission // is assigned the anchor `xyz`

== Discussion
The vocabulary is authorised by {{ISO}} and {{IEC,the IEC}}.

// equivalent to the sentence above
The vocabulary is authorised by symbol:[ISO] and symbol:[IEC,the IEC].
----

Unlike terms, symbols and abbreviations are not italicised, referenced, or
hyperlinked by default.

____
The vocabulary is authorised by ISO and IEC.
____
====


===== Reference by anchor

In certain cases it is more appropriate to reference a concept (defined
in the current document) by anchor, instead of by term, e.g.:

* the defined term is not plain text, e.g., a math formula;
* the defined term is long in length.

To reference a concept by anchor, the anchor of the concept should be provided,
and optionally the text to be displayed. The anchor must be given in angle
brackets, like a normal cross-reference in Metanorma AsciiDoc.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* anchor of the concept;
* (optional) text to be displayed.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
// The concept is from the current document, but a manual anchor has been
// created for referencing it as a shorthand, useful in the case where a
// concept term is not in plain text (e.g. MathML).
{{<<identifier>>}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term, referred through
// an anchor.
{{<<identifier>>,display-text}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term, referred through
// an anchor, and we also want to provide a canonical name for the term.
{{<<identifier>>,canonical-term,display-text}}
----

----
====


==== Concepts from external documents

To refer to concepts from an external document requires a corresponding
bibliographic anchor for that document. The identifier for the concept
is then given in the same fashion as any citation of an external document.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* bibliographic anchor of the external document, optionally including the
  locality of the term definition in that document;
* concept term name;
* (optional) text to be displayed;
* (optional) cross-reference text to be displayed.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
// The concept is from the current document but a manual anchor has been
// created for referencing it as a shorthand, useful in the case where a
// concept term is not in plain text (e.g. MathML).
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term, referred through
// an anchor.
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term,display-text}}

// If the cross-reference text for the external document needs to be overriden.
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

plentiful in the literature.
____
====


NOTE: Metanorma Semantic XML preserves the information that the latter term is
cited as _unripe kernels_, but is defined as _immature kernel_. However by
default, only the display text is rendered.

To supplement the concept reference with a locality, the `bibliographic-anchor`
element can be supplemented by a comma-delimited list of
link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography#localities[localities and locality values],
as is normal for a reference to a locality in an external document.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<bibliographic-anchor,locality=X>>,term}}

// Simple example:
{{<<iso639-1,clause=3.1>>,language}}

// If the display text differs from the cited term:
{{<<bibliographic-anchor,locality1=X>>,term,display-text}}

// Multiple localities can be used:
{{<<bibliographic-anchor,clause=4.7,table=1>>,display-text}}

==== Concepts from external termbase

To refer to a concept from an external termbase, the termbase
identifier and the concept identifier within that termbase are needed.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* termbase identifier;
* concept identifier within that termbase;
* (optional) text to be displayed for the term;
* (optional) text to be displayed for the termbase reference.

NOTE: The presence of a colon identifies the first argument in a term citation
as identifying an external termbase term, since colons are not permitted in
cross-references or bibliographic anchors.

NOTE: Termbase identifiers are treated as special anchors, they do not need
to be defined using a bibliographic reference anchor.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term.
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term,display-text}}

// If the text of the cross-reference to the termbase needs to be overridden.
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

NOTE: The termbase does not require a corresponding reference in the
bibliography.

Currently, only the IEC Electropedia (IEV) is supported, where the
reference syntax is `<<IEV:{IEV concept ID}>>`.

[source,adoc]
----
// Not necessary to define the IEV bibliographic anchor.
{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,term}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term.
{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,text,display-term}}

// If the IEV citation text differs from the flavour default.
{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,text,display-term,cross-reference-text}}

==== Rendering options

The following rendering options, introduced with `options="..."`, are defined
for concept mentions.

`ital`:: italicise the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]

`ref`:: provide a reference for the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]

`noref`:: do not provide a reference for the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]

`linkmention`:: hyperlink the rendered term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]

`nolinkmention`:: do not hyperlink the rendered term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]

`linkref`:: hyperlink the reference for the term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]

`nolinkref`:: do not hyperlink the reference for the term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]

If these options are missing, Metanorma applies the defaults for the current
flavour.

The default behaviour in Metanorma is `ital,ref,nolinkmention,linkref` for all
terms, `noital,noref,nolinkmention,nolinkref` for acronyms.

In ISO, the default behaviour for terms is refined:

* for terms outside the "`Terms and definitions`" section: `noital,noref,nolinkmention,nolinkref`;

* for the first mention of a term within the "`Terms and definitions`" section: `ital,ref,nolinkmention,linkref`;

* for all subsequent mentions within the "`Terms and definitions`" section: `ital,noref,nolinkmention,linkref`.
