title: How to add diagrams
description: Diagrams are useful to visualize the structure of a system or processes. Metanorma supports the PlantUML diagramming tool, so that you can create different kinds of diagrams directly in a Metanorma document.

=== Prerequisites

You need to have PlantUML installed in order to use this feature. To install PlantUML, see link:/software/metanorma-cli/docs/installation/#plantuml[installation notes] for further details.

=== Adding a diagram

To add one or more diagrams in a Metanorma document:

. Begin a new literal block and use the attribute `[plantuml]`.
+ 
The compiler now knows that PlantUML syntax follows.
. Begin the diagram with `@startuml`.
. Enter your diagram using the PlantUML notation.
. End the diagram with `@enduml`.

Example:
[source,asciidoc]
--
[plantuml]
....
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml
....
--

Once you compile the document, the compiler will transform your text input into a PNG image. The images are stored in the plantuml directory.
