tag::tutorial[]
Information that forms a logical segment, such as a paragraph or a list, is called a block.
Most blocks start and end with a https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#delimited-blocks[delimiter] which is a matching sequence of characters. The delimiters tell the compiler that the text they contain belongs together.

.Examples for different blocks
[source,adoc]
------
I'm a paragraph and I don't need a block delimiter.
<1>
. I'm a list item and also do not need a delimiter
. I'm the second list item
. I'm list item number three

//// <2>
I'm a comment.

print("Hello World!")

<1> Paragraphs and lists are types of blocks that do not need any delimiters. They are separated by a blank line in between blocks.
<2> Comments use four slashes as a delimiter `////`. No other block uses slashes to begin and end a block.
<3> All other types of blocks rely on delimiters, such as four dashes `----` or four equal signs `====`. This block contains a code sample written in python.


There are many types of blocks in AsciiDoc, such as:
* Paragraphs
* Lists
* Tables
* Images
* Admonitions (Note, Caution, Warning, etc.)
* Examples
* Code samples
* Mathematic formulas
* Term definitions
* Comments
* Reviewer Notes
