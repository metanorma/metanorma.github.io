= Metanorma markup for IEEE

== Clauses

=== Prefatory

The abstract of the document is marked up as a clause with the style attribute `[abstract]`.

The keywords of the document are given as the comma-delimited `:keywords:` document attribute.

The introduction of the document is marked up as a clause with the title "Introduction".
The initial boxed text, "This introduction is not part of P&lt;designation&gt;/D&lt;draft_number&gt;, Draft &lt;Gde./Rec. Prac./Std.&gt; for &lt;Complete Title Matching PAR&gt;." is automatically generated and populated by Metanorma.
Do not provide it.

The permissions of the document are marked up as a clause with the title "Acknowledgements".

The templated material ("boilerplate") of the document front matter is all automatically provided by
Metanorma:

* Front page: Copyright statement, license statement
* Second page: Contact statement, ISBNs
* Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE Standards Documents
* Participants statement (the membership of the various committees is provided as document attributes)

== Overview

The _Overview_ clause, and its _Scope_, _Purpose_ and _Word Usage_ subclauses, are recognised automatically from the supplied clause headers.

The _Word Usage_ subclause is mandatory, but is not autopopulated by Metanorma. The text is however included in
the Metanorma template for IEEE.

=== References

The introductory paragraph for normative references and bibliographies is automatically generated by Metanorma.

Normative references are automatically sorted by designator, by Metanorma. Bibliography references are automatically
sorted by designators or author and title, by Metanorma.

The bibliography is marked up as a subclause of an annex: the bibliography heading is overwritten by the annex heading,
but it must still be given as "Bibliography" to be recognised correctly.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix]
== Bibliographic Excursus

[bibliography]
=== Bibliography
----

=== Definitions

Definitions are recognised as a clause with the title "Definitions" or "Terms and definitions".

Definitions are sorted by Metanorma.

The notation for subdefinitions and cross-references in Metanorma is:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== widget

alt:[doovywhack] // Syn:

related:contrast[thing] // Contrast:

related:seealso[whatsit] // See also:

[.definition]
--
device performing an unspecified function.
--

[.definition]
--
general metasyntactic variable.
--
----

which renders as:

____

*widget*: *(A)* device performing an unspecified function. *(B)* general metasyntactic variable. _Contrast:_ thing.
_Syn:_ doovywhack. _See also:_ whatsit.
____

Do NOT insert markup for _See:_ terms. _See:_ terms are the opposite relations to "Syn:" relations; Metanorma will 
automatically generate an entry for the synonymous term, pointing back to the original entry:

___

*doovywhack*: _See:_ widget.
___

Do use `+alt:[...]+` for synonyms, rather than `related:equivalent[]`: the latter is intended to cross-reference
pre-existing term definitions, and that is not how IEEE treats _Syn:_ entries.

Do use `+alt:[...]+` instead of `+preferred[...]+` for _Syn:_ entries. The `+preferred[...]+` syntax is intended for 
names that are fully equivalent in preference, such as acronyms.

TODO: acronyms

Metanorma supports _concepts_, which capture terms are cross-referencable entities, including cross-references
within Terms & Definitions sections. Highlighting and cross-referencing of concepts is not supported in Metanorma for IEEE.

Term sources are marked up as "adapted from" through an `adapted` option on the source tag:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.source%adapted]
<<reference>>
----

rendered as

____
[definition]  (adapted from [reference])
____

=== Annexes

Normative and informative annexes are differentiated with the `obligation` attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix,obligation=normative]
== Rules for implementation

[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Suggestions for implementation
----

Bibliographies are encoded as the children of informative annexes; Metanorma will take care of rendering the annex title
properly, without a redundant subclause.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Bibliography

[bibliography]
=== Bibliography
----

== Blocks

=== Notes

The footnote on first appearance of a note,

____
Notes to text, tables, and figures are for information only and do not contain requirements needed to implement the standard.
____

is automatically generated by Metanorma.

=== Tables

Table heads and table subheads are marked up as header cells. They are differentiated by line break:

[source,asciidoc]
----
|===
| Header1 | Header2

h| Table Row Head +
Table Row Subhead | Value
----

== Inline

=== Cross-references

Omission of "clause" at the start of a sentence for cross-references to subclauses is done automatically
by Metanorma. If Metanorma's detection of the start of a sentence is incorrect, you can override Metanorma's
auto-generated text, by providing it explicitly within the cross-reference, e.g. `<<xref1,Clause 3.1>>`.

References to the bibliography are automatically populated by designator and bibliographic number (e.g. _ISO 639-2, [B1]_),
if the reference is to a standard or technical report, or otherwise by title and bibliographic number. If you wish to
override that, e.g. by using authors instead of title, you should populate the cross-reference text, e.g.
`<<ref1,Boswell and Johnson [B2]>>`.

=== Footnotes

If a footnote is repeated, Metanorma automatically detects that and converts it into a cross-reference ("See Footnote 1.")
A repeat footnote can be marked up using the `footnote` macro target (`abc` in the following example; any identifier can be used),
and with the repeat footnote text left blank.

[source,asciidoc]
----
Hello.footnote:abc[This is a footnote]

Repetition.footnote:abc[]
----

== Validation

Metanorma issues warnings for the document against the following rules from the Style Manual:

* The title of the document starts as "(Draft) (Trial-Use) (Standards|Recommended Practice|Guide)" (11.3). This is done automatically by Metanorma if all the relevant document attributes are populated.
* The title contains no uncapitalised words other than prepositions (11.3).
* No cross-reference ranges are used: "See Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3", not "See Figures 1 through 3" (17.2). This is only checked against autonumbered cross-references.
* Undated references should not contain identify specific elements of the referenced text (12.3.2).
* Normative references should be dated (12.3.1).
* There should be no more than one ordered list within a numbered clause (13.3).
* The names of supplied images in figures and tables must follow the prescribed naming conventions (17.1).
* Figure headings should be capitalised (17.2).
* The document must contain an Overview clause, a Scope clause, a Word Usage clause (12.2).
* The Overview clause must occur first, and contain the Scope clause and the Word Usage clause (12.2).
* There should be no more than five levels of subclauses (13.1).
* No subclause should be the only child of its parent (13.1).
* Decimal comma should not be used (14.2).
* Decimals must have a leading zero if less than 1 (14.2).
* There must be space before the percent sign (14.2).
* There must be space between numerals and recognised SI units (14.2).
* Units must be given on both value and tolerance for an SI unit (14.2).
* Numbers occurring in tables should be broken up in threes, unless they are four-digit sequences and all other digits are at most three digits (16.3.2).
* Table headings and header cells should be capitalised (16.2).
* The document should contain Normative Refences and Definitions (12.2).
* The bibliography should be either the first or the last annex of the document (19.1).
* Unordered lists should be no more than two levels deep.
* Ordered lists should be no more than five levels deep.
