=== Prefatory

The abstract of the document is marked up as a clause with the style attribute `[abstract]`.

The keywords of the document are given as the comma-delimited `:keywords:` document attribute.

The introduction of the document is marked up as a clause with the title "Introduction".
The initial boxed text,
"This introduction is not part of P{designation}/D{draft_number}, Draft {document-type} for {par-title}"
is automatically generated and populated by Metanorma.
Do not provide it.

The permissions of the document are marked up as a clause with the title "Acknowledgements".

The templated material ("boilerplate") of the document front matter is all
automatically provided by Metanorma:

* Front page: Copyright statement, license statement
* Second page: Contact statement, ISBNs
* Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE Standards Documents
* Participants statement (the membership of the various committees is provided in a <<participants,Participants>> clause)
* The note before the overview in amendments, indicating how formatting is to be interpreted

[[participants]]
== Participants

While there is a Participants clause in the supplied IEEE boilerplate, it is very frequently added to and modified
in IEEE documents. Metanorma allows it to be customised as follows:

* The initial sentence before each of the Working Group, Balloting Group, and Standards Board listings is supplied
by Metanorma, with the templated wording taken from IEEE; e.g. the sentence
+
--
____
The following members of the <individual/entity> Standards Association balloting group voted on this <gde./rec. prac./std.>. Balloters may have voted for approval, disapproval, or abstention.
____

with the document type and the type of ballotting group supplied by Metanorma.
--
* The remainder of the content is provided in three subclauses of a `== Participants` clause supplied by the author:
`=== Working Group`, `=== Balloting Group`, and `=== Standards Board`:
+
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Participants
=== Working Group
....
=== Balloting Group
....
=== Standards Board
....
----

The first `== Participants` clause found in a document will be processed for boilerplate content, and removed from
the document by Metanorma
--
** If you have an actual clause titled `== Participants` which needs to be left alone, insert `[heading=clause]` before
it to prevent it being recognised as a boilerplate Participants clause.
* The first item in each subclause is expected to be a list of participants. The list is expected to be a list of
definition lists, with each definition list giving the attributes of the participant (`name` for persons,
`company` for entities, `role`). Because of how cumbersome it is to enter lists of definition lists in Asciidoctor,
Metanorma will also recognise a definition list of definition lists, with each participant introduced by `item::`.
So the participants list is entered as follows:
+
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
item::
name::: Arthur C. Clark
role::: Chair
item::
name::: Alessandro Volta
role::: Vice-Chair
item::
company::: Apple Inc.
role::: Member
item::
name::: Claude Elwood Shannon
role::: Member
----
--
** If no `role` is specified, it is assumed to be "Member". 
+
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
item::
name::: Arthur C. Clark
role::: Chair
item::
name::: Alessandro Volta
role::: Vice-Chair
item::
company::: Apple Inc.
item::
name::: Claude Elwood Shannon
----
--
** If only a list of names is given, each entry is assumed to
be a personal name as a member:
+
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
item::
name::: Arthur C. Clark
role::: Chair
item::
name::: Alessandro Volta
role::: Vice-Chair
item::
company::: Apple Inc.
item:: Claude Elwood Shannon
item:: Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
----

[source,asciidoc]
----
* Nikola Tesla
* Thomas Edison
* Henry Ford
----
--
* Participant lists should be given in the order they will be rendered in, with office-holders before members,
and organisation members before individual members.
* The paragraph explaining that asterisk indicates emeritus members is inserted automatically by Metanorma.
* Documents often insert additional lists of participants and acknowledgements. Any list or definition list
in the user-supplied Participants clause is treated and processed the same way.
* The Word and PDF rendering of the participants listings automatically works out the differential rendering
of member organisations and individual members in two or three columns.

== Overview

The _Overview_ clause, and its _Scope_, _Purpose_ and _Word Usage_ subclauses,
are recognised automatically from the supplied clause headers.

The _Word Usage_ subclause is mandatory for normal documents (as distinct from amendments and corrigenda),
and is auto-populated by Metanorma. Do not supply it.

=== References

The introductory paragraph for normative references and bibliographies is
automatically generated by Metanorma.

Normative references are automatically sorted by designator, by Metanorma. Bibliography references are automatically
sorted by designators or author and title, by Metanorma.

The bibliography is marked up as a subclause of an annex: the bibliography
heading is overwritten by the annex heading, but it must still be given as
"Bibliography" to be recognised correctly.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix]
== Bibliographic Excursus

[bibliography]
=== Bibliography
----

=== Definitions

Definitions are recognised as a clause with the title "Definitions" or "Terms
and definitions".

Definitions are sorted by Metanorma.

The notation for subdefinitions and cross-references in Metanorma is:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== widget

preferred:[WgT] // acronym

alt:[doovywhack] // Syn:

related:contrast[thing] // Contrast:

related:seealso[whatsit] // See also:

[.definition]
--
device performing an unspecified function.
--

[.definition]
--
general metasyntactic variable.
--
----

which renders as:

____

*widget (WgT)*: *(A)* device performing an unspecified function. *(B)* general metasyntactic variable. _Contrast:_ thing.
_Syn:_ doovywhack. _See also:_ whatsit.
____

Do NOT insert markup for _See:_ terms. _See:_ terms are the opposite relations to "Syn:" relations; Metanorma will 
automatically generate an entry for the synonymous term, pointing back to the original entry:

___

*doovywhack*: _See:_ widget.
___

Do use `+alt:[...]+` for synonyms, rather than `related:equivalent[]`: the latter is intended to cross-reference
pre-existing term definitions, and that is not how IEEE treats _Syn:_ entries.

Do use `+alt:[...]+` instead of `+preferred[...]+` for _Syn:_ entries. The `+preferred[...]+` syntax is intended for 
names that are fully equivalent in preference, such as acronyms.

Do use a second `+preferred:[...]+` term, to introduce equally valid term designations, such as abbreviations and acronyms;
they will be displayed in brackets after the initial term.

Metanorma supports _concepts_, which capture terms are cross-referencable entities, including cross-references
within Terms & Definitions sections. Highlighting and cross-referencing of concepts is not supported in Metanorma for IEEE.

Term sources are marked up as "adapted from" through an `adapted` option on the source tag:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.source%adapted]
<<reference>>
----

rendered as

____
[definition]  (adapted from [reference])
____

=== Annexes

Normative and informative annexes are differentiated with the `obligation` attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix,obligation=normative]
== Rules for implementation

[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Suggestions for implementation
----

Bibliographies are encoded as the children of informative annexes; Metanorma
will take care of rendering the annex title properly, without a redundant
subclause.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Bibliography

[bibliography]
=== Bibliography
----

== Blocks

=== Notes

The footnote on first appearance of a note,

____
Notes to text, tables, and figures are for information only and do not contain
requirements needed to implement the standard.
____

is automatically generated by Metanorma.

=== Tables

Table heads and table subheads are marked up as header cells. They are differentiated by line break:

[source,asciidoc]
----
|===
| Header1 | Header2

h| Table Row Head +
Table Row Subhead | Value
----

== Inline

=== Cross-references

Omission of "clause" at the start of a sentence for cross-references to
subclauses is done automatically by Metanorma. If Metanorma's detection of the
start of a sentence is incorrect, you can override Metanorma's auto-generated
text, by providing it explicitly within the cross-reference, e.g.
`<<xref1,Clause 3.1>>`.

References to the bibliography are automatically populated by designator and bibliographic number (e.g. _ISO 639-2, [B1]_),
if the reference is to a standard or technical report, or otherwise by title and bibliographic number. If you wish to
override that, e.g. by using authors instead of title, you should populate the cross-reference text, e.g.
`<<ref1,Boswell and Johnson [B2]>>`.

=== Footnotes

If a footnote is repeated, Metanorma automatically detects that and converts it
into a cross-reference ("See Footnote 1.")

A repeat footnote can be marked up using the `footnote` macro target (`abc` in
the following example; any identifier can be used), and with the repeat footnote
text left blank.

[source,asciidoc]
----
Hello.footnote:abc[This is a footnote]

Repetition.footnote:abc[]
----

== Validation

Metanorma issues warnings for the document against the following rules from the
Style Manual:

* The title of the document starts as "(Draft) (Trial-Use)
(Standards|Recommended Practice|Guide)" (11.3). This is done automatically by
Metanorma if all the relevant document attributes are populated.

* The title contains no uncapitalised words other than prepositions (11.3).

* No cross-reference ranges are used: "See Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3", not
"See Figures 1 through 3" (17.2). This is only checked against autonumbered
cross-references.

* Undated references should not contain identify specific elements of the
referenced text (12.3.2).

* Normative references should be dated (12.3.1).

* There should be no more than one ordered list within a numbered clause (13.3).

* The names of supplied images in figures and tables must follow the prescribed
naming conventions (17.1).

* Figure headings should be capitalised (17.2).

* The document must contain an Overview clause, a Scope clause, a Word Usage
clause (12.2).

* The Overview clause must occur first, and contain the Scope clause and the
Word Usage clause (12.2).

* There should be no more than five levels of subclauses (13.1).

* No subclause should be the only child of its parent (13.1).

* Decimal comma should not be used (14.2).

* Decimals must have a leading zero if less than 1 (14.2).

* There must be space before the percent sign (14.2).

* There must be space between numerals and recognised SI units (14.2).

* Units must be given on both value and tolerance for an SI unit (14.2).

* Numbers occurring in tables should be broken up in threes, unless they are
four-digit sequences and all other digits are at most three digits (16.3.2).

* Table headings and header cells should be capitalised (16.2).

* The document should contain Normative Refences and Definitions (12.2).

* The bibliography should be either the first or the last annex of the document
(19.1).

* Amendment/corrigenda changes should start with one of _Change_, _Insert_, _Delete_,
_Replace_, reflecting the kind of change involved (20.2.2). [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v0.1.0]

* Unordered lists should be no more than two levels deep.

* Ordered lists should be no more than five levels deep.
