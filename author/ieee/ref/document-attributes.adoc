= Metanorma IEEE SA document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ieee]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of IEEE SA documents
in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just IEEE SA.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

these words are supplied automatically by Metanorma.
+
NOTE: `:doctitle:` can be set using the first line of the
AsciiDoc markup, prefaced by `= ` instead of setting the document attribute.


== Document relationships

`:merges:`:: This document incorporates the document(s) with the nominated
identifiers (semicolon-delimited).

`:updates:`:: This document is an update of the document(s) with the nominated
identifiers (semicolon-delimited).


== Document contributors

=== General

There are the multiple kinds of contributors to an IEEE SA document that
indicate full provenance of where the document was developed, balloted and
eventually approved.

IEEE requires listing of all members of the:

* working group
* balloting group
* standards board, at the time of publishing the document.

The current membership of the balloting group and standards board is normally
provided by IEEE during editing; if the information is not provided in the
document, dummy values will be provided to match those in the IEEE templates.


=== Society

An IEEE SA document is sponsored by an IEEE society.
This is mandatory information.

`society`:: The IEEE society responsible for the document. Do not include the
"IEEE" prefix.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `society`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:society: Computer Society
----

=== Committee

An IEEE SA document is developed within a working group under an IEEE SA
committee.
This is mandatory information.

`committee`:: The committee responsible for the document.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `committee`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:committee: C/AISC - Artificial Intelligence Standards Committee

=== Working group

An IEEE SA document is developed by a working group.
Members of the working group are to be fully elaborated as metadata
presented in the document preface.

This is mandatory information.

An IEEE SA working group can be one of two modes
(more details at link:/author/ieee/ref/process[process]):

* Entity-based: members are IEEE SA member organizations, use the `:wg-org-members:` attribute to specify
member organizations;
* Individual-based: members are individual contributors, use the `:wg-members:` attribute to specify
member individuals.

`working-group`:: The working group responsible for the document.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `working-group`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:working-group: Spatial Web Working Group
----
====

`wg-chair`:: The working group chair.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `wg-chair`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:wg-chair: Gabriel Rene
----
====

`wg-vicechair`:: The working group vice-chair.
+

====

`wg-secretary`:: The working group secretary.

`wg-members`:: If a working group is in "individual mode", this attribute stores
the names of individual working group members. Values are to be
semicolon-delimited. (One of `wg-members` and `wg-org-members` must be specified.)

`wg-org-members`:: If a working group is in "entity mode", this attribute stores
the names of organisations that are working group members. Values are to be
semicolon-delimited. (One of `wg-members` and `wg-org-members` must be
specified.)

=== Balloting group

The balloting group, or balloting committee, is the group that recommends
the document for approval as a standard by the IEEE SA Standardization board.

The balloting group is composed of voting members of the working group, or the
committee that the working group belongs to.

`balloting-group`:: The Standards Association balloting group responsible for the document.
`balloting-group-type`:: The type of the Standards Association balloting group responsible for the document,
_individual_ or _entity_ (default: _individual_).

`balloting-group-members`:: The balloting group members, semicolon-delimited.

=== Standardization board

The standardization board at the time of document publication is rendered
in the document preface.

`std-board-chair`:: The standards board chair.

`std-board-vicechair`:: The standards board vice-chair.

`std-board-pastchair`:: The standards board past chair.

`std-board-secretary`:: The standards board secretary.

`std-board-members`:: The standards board members, semicolon-delimited. Any
emeritus members should be given with an asterisk at the end of their names.

== Visual appearance

`:hierarchical-object-numbering:`::
If set, do not number tables and figures consecutively throughout the body of the
document, but restart numbering with each clause (hierarchically). +
+
Use in complex documents, with multiple tables or figures, that need to be tracked against
clauses for ease of lookup (so _Figure 6-3, Figure 6-4_, instead of _Figure 21, Figure 22_.)
