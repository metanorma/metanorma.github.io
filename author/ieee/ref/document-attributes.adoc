= Metanorma IEEE document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ieee]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of ITU documents in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma authorâ€™s documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just ITU.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
