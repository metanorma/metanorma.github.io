== General

The easiest way to ensure that you are following the document structure that IEEE
demands, is to use a Metanorma template.

If you author a document type that doesn't have a template, check a
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-ieee[sample document] for better
understanding how to structure that document.

Typically, an IEEE SA document contains the following content order:

* <<preliminary,Preliminary sections>>
* <<terms,Terms and definitions>>
* <<refs,References>>
* <<content,Content sections>>
* <<annex,Annex sections>>

[[preliminary]]
include::author/ieee/topics/markup.adoc[tag=preliminary-ieee]

[[terms]]
== Terms and definitions

The terms and definitions is used to define important terms and cite them
throughout the standard.

[[refs]]
== References

The references section contains normative references, it is considered a
"`bibliography`" section.

Learn how to
link:/author/ogc/authoring-guide/bibliography[enter bibliographic entries].

NOTE: In IEEE there are two "`bibliography`" sections. The "`References`"
section for normative references, and the "`Bibliography`" section which is for
informative references.


[[content]]
== Content sections

After the sections above, any number of content sections can be added.

[[annex]]
== Annex sections

=== General

Annex sections are declared by prepending the `[appendix]` tag above the section
declaration.
Annexes can be added as necessary.

An annex can either be _normative_ or _informative_. By default an annex is
marked _informative_.

In order to declare a _normative_ annex, use the _obligation_ attribute in
the following manner: `[appendix,obligation=normative]`

.Example of creating a normative versus an information annex
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// Without declaration, an annex is informative.
[appendix]
== Informative annex title
...

// A normative annex.
[appendix,obligation=normative]
== Normative annex title
...

// A informative annex with explicit declaration
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Informative annex title
...

Annex clauses are placed after all content sections, right before the
bibliography section.
