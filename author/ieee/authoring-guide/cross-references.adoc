== General

Cross-references are an integral part of standards.
The main mechanism for references are anchors and destinations.

There are the following types of cross-references:

// * link:/author/topics/sections/entering-bib[Bibliographic entries]
* link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs[Internal references]
* link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography[Bibliographic entries]
* Hyperlinks to external sources (e.g., a link to a website)

The following clauses will provide the basics on how cross-referencing
works in Metanorma.


== Internal references

=== General

To link to an important section, table, figure, formula, or list item in your document:

. Set an anchor using double square brackets before the content you want to reference: `\[[anchor]]`.
+
.Example for an anchor preceding an image
[source,adoc]
----
[[figureC-1]]
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::images/rice_image2.png[Image of the gelatinization curve]
----
+
.Rendered image caption
image::/assets/author/learn/references_img_anchor.jpg[]

. To reference an anchor, type the anchor name like this `\<<anchor>>`.
+

----
<<figureC-1>> gives an example of a typical gelatinization curve.
----
+
.Rendered reference
image::/assets/author/learn/references_img_target.jpg[]

. To set an alternative text other than the anchor text, append the text inside the brackets using a comma.

=== Auto-numbering of references

Metanorma automatically numbers and names references; because they are
auto-numbered, they will be renumbered automatically if you insert any new text
of the same type.

Metanorma markup is serialized into XML, hence the anchor should follow the
https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/[XML namespace conventions].

i.e., an anchor name name must not contain:

* colons
* whitespaces
* words starting with numbers

== Hyperlinks

It is easy to include links to external sources in Metanorma, and sources to
files within the same project.

To reference an *internal* source:

. Use the `link` command to include a link to a file. The syntax looks like this: `\link:PATH[]`.

. Add link text in square brackets after the path.
+

To reference an *external* source:

. Paste the URL into the document.
. Add link text in square brackets after the URL (optional) `URL[Link text]`.
