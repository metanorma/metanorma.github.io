predefined content that is automatically inserted into the output in accordance
to flavor requirements

== clause (also _section_)

logical group of content that is numerically identified in ascending order

== subclause (also _subsection_)

clause that belongs to a top-level clause or another subclause

== cross-reference

link to a location in the current document or in another external document

== document attribute

key-value pair that specifies execution configuration or
provides metadata at the document level

NOTE: A Metanorma document attribute key-value pair is implemented using the
syntax of `:{key}: {value}`.

== block attribute

key-value pair that specifies execution configuration or provides metadata at
the block level

NOTE: A Metanorma document attribute key-value pair is implemented using the
syntax of `{key}={value}`.

== Metanorma flavor

Metanorma implementation that conforms to a publishing organization's content
model

NOTE: Conformance of content covers validity of content, the content generation
process, and formatting of deliverables.

or a draft identified by a combination of the project number and draft number

are presented

== IEEE Guide

IEEE standards document in which alternative approaches to good practice are
suggested but no clear-cut recommendations are made

These levels of requirements are often shown by the use of particular “standards verbs,” i.e., “shall” for requirements, “should” for recommendations, and “may” for guidelines. (more information can be found in the IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual and the IEEE SA Standards Style Manual) Figuring out what level of requirement is needed helps determine what kind of document should be developed.
