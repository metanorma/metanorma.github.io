title: Typical sections in OGC

== General

The easiest way to ensure that you are following the document structure that OGC
demands, is to use a Metanorma template.

If you author a document type that doesn't have a template, you can look at a
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-ogc[sample document] for better
understanding how to structure that document.

Typically, an OGC document contains:

* <<preliminary,Preliminary sections>>
* <<terms,Terms and definitions>>
* <<refs,References>>
* <<content,Content sections>>
* <<annex,Annex sections>>

[[preliminary]]
include::author/ogc/topics/markup.adoc[tag=preliminary-ogc]

[[terms]]
== Terms and definitions

The terms and definitions is used to define important terms and cite them throughout the standard.

[[refs]]
== References

The refernces section contains normative references, also known as a bibliography section.

[[content]]
== Content sections

After all the preliminary sections, and the terms and definitions section, you may add as many content sections as you need.

[[annex]]
== Annex

Annex clauses are declared by prepending the `[appendix]` tag to the clause.
You can add as many annexes as you need.

An annex can either be _normative_ or _informative_. By default an annex is
_informative_.

In order to declare a _normative_ appendix, we use the _obligation_ attribute in
the following manner: `[appendix,obligation=normative]`

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix,obligation=normative]
== Normative appendix title
...

// Default case; "obligation=informative" markup can be omitted.
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Informative appendix title
...
----

The annex clauses allocate in the last position of the main content right before
the bibliography clause.

=== Glossary as an appendix

include::author/ogc/topics/markup.adoc[tag=glossary]

=== Annex ordering

An annex titled "Revision History" is moved after all other annexes. A glossary annex
is moved after all other annexes, except for the Revision History [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.0.1].
