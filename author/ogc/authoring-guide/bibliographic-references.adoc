== General

Standard documents typically contain bibliographic references, and those
references are usually presented in two categories:

* Normative references
* Informative references

In OGC deliverables, bibliographic references are put into these two sections:

* "`Normative references`", contain normative references, located at Clause 3;
* "`Bibliography`", contain informative references, placed as the last Annex.

== Creating a bibliographic section

Every bibliographic section must be preceded by the style attribute
`[bibliography]` so that bibliographic references are recognized as such.

Place them into the Normative references if they are a required part of this
standard.

== Entering a bibliographic entry

Bibliographic references (citations) are entered using a specialized list syntax.

. Starts with a list item indicator (`*`).

. Followed by a pair of triple square brackets (`[[[ ... ]]]`) which contains

** A unique anchor name used to reference this entry. This anchor has to be unique per document.

** A document identifier (also called the "`reference tag`") that identifies
this reference to the reader. If the cited document is a standard, it is likely
that Metanorma can link:/author/basics/reference-lookups[automatically fetch bibliographic information] for it via https://www.relaton.org/[Relaton].
+
NOTE: If Metanorma recognizes a document identifier, it will overwrite any title
you provide with the authoritative title of the reference.

. After the triple brackets, the citation text is entered manually. OGC uses
the
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines[Springer LNCS bibliographic style],
which is now officially called the "Springer MathPhys style"
(https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/manuscript-preparation/5636[guidelines]).

== Referencing a bibliographic entry

There are two ways to cite a bibliography entry entered in the bibliography
sections.

. Cite the whole document, by cross-referencing the anchor name like this: `\<<OGC_08-094>>`.

. Cite a particular locality of the document, by cross-referencing the anchor name but additionally specify a link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography/#localities[locality] as the second argument, like this: `\<<OGC_08-094,part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>`.

== Auto-fetching OGC references

Relaton fetches bibliographic entries for OGC documents, when the syntax matches the following:

//Line 62 stems from https://www.metanorma.org/author/topics/building/reference-lookup/. To me, the parenthesis are a bit confusing. In which context do we use it?
`OGC(identifier)` (e.g. `OGC(14-083r2)`, `OGC 14-083r2`), or any identifier prefixed with `OGC`.

* If Relaton *can* resolve the reference, the bibliographic information from the database will be rendered.
