= Writing OGC documents using Metanorma

== Document type and stage

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ogc]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of OGC documents in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma authorâ€™s documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just OGC.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

=== Author info

`:committee:`::
*Mandatory.*
Name of relevant committee producing the document. Use one of:
+
--
* `technical`: Technical Committee
* `planning`: Planning Committee
* `strategic-member-advisory`: Strategic Member Advisory Committee
--

`:subcommittee-type:`::
The type of the relevant subcommittee producing the document.

`:subcommittee-number:`::
The number of the relevant subcommittee producing the document.

`:workingGroup:`::
*Mandatory.*
Name of relevant working group producing the document.

`:workgroup-type:`::
Type of the relevant workgroup producing the document.

`:workgroup-number:`::
Number of the relevant workgroup producing the document.

`:submitting-organizations:`::
Semicolon-delimited list of the submitting organizations
for this document. The organization names themselves may contain commas.
+
[example]
--
EXAMPLE: _University of Calgary, Canada; National Central University, Taiwan_
--

`:editor:`::
Same as `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#fullname[:fullname:]`
alongside `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#role[:role:]` specified as `editor`.


=== URIs and IDs

`:external-id:`::
External identifier referring to this document. If not supplied, a default value is
generated: `http://www.opengis.net/doc/{abbrevation of doctype}/{abbrev}/{version}`.
(Version is omitted if not provided. If `:abbrev:` and `:doctype:` are not provided,
the default value is not generated.

`:referenceURLID:`::
Identifier embedded into a document type-specific external URL.

`:previous-uri:`::
URI of previous version of the document.

`:docnumber:`::
The document number assigned to the OGC document (without the "`OGC`" prefix). +
+
The number is formulated following the following rules:
+
* The final two digits of the year are used at the start of the number (`YY`).
* A three digit number is assigned sequentially for each document in the year (`NNN`).
* The first edition of a document has the document number `YY-NNN`; for example, `00-027` is OGC document 027 first published in 2000.
* Minor editorial changes and corrigenda do not result in a change to the document number
* The `YY-NNN` identifier for a document (the document number root) is maintained if the document undergoes content changes (revisions). These revisions are numbered sequentially, and are indicated with `r` followed by the revision number. So `05-020r27` is revision 27 of OGC document 020 first published in 2005. (Revision 27 may appear years later than 2005.)
* A new major version of a document receives a new document number, including likely a new year.

=== Mapping to OGC legacy AsciiDoc

Metanorma-OGC permits legacy OGC AsciiDoc template attributes,
and are treated as synonyms of the corresponding Metanorma attributes:

|===
| OGC Metanorma AsciiDoc                    | OGC legacy AsciiDoc

| `:copyright-year:`                        | `:copyrightYear`
| `:workgroup:`                             | `:workingGroup:`
| `:published-date:`                        | `:publicationDate:`
| `:issued-date:`                           | `:approvalDate:`
| `:received-date:`                         | `:submissionDate:`
| `:docnumber:`                             | `:docReference:`
| `:fullname:`, with `:role:` = `editor`    | `:editor:`
| `:edition:`                               | `:version:`

|===

== Markup

=== General

The rendering of OGC documents has changed over the years. Metanorma formats OGC documents
following current practice:

* All body text is left justified, with no exceptions allowed.
* Where section obligations are named (i.e. in annex names), they are only given as
"normative" or "informative"; the alternate text of "non-normative" is disallowed.
* Ordered lists follow ISO style numbering, i.e. "a), b), c) ...", with no exceptions allowed.

=== Inline formatting

Metanorma-OGC supports highlighting of text [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.2.16]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
This is #text to be highlighted#.
----

=== Sections

The Normative References section may be named just "`References`", reflecting OGC practice.

=== Preliminary elements


==== General

The following clauses are preliminary elements, and are moved into the frontispiece
of the document (in Metanorma, the document preface).

The OGC DocTeam has specified that all these elements are *MANDATORY* in OGC documents (in this order):

* Abstract
* Keywords
* Preface
* Security Considerations [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.2.5]
* Submitting Organizations
* Submitters

The Foreword and Introduction are not recognised as part of the document preface
by default [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.2].

[NOTE]
--
Additional preliminary sections are *allowed* but not encouraged.
There are two mechanisms for adding additional content as preliminary elements:

. Add their content in the <<ogc-full-preface,Full Preface>> as additional sub-sections
. Add them as <<ogc-additional-prelim,additional preliminary elements>>
--

==== Abstract

The abstract is recognized as the first clause with an `abstract` style attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[abstract]
== Abstract

This standard describes a conceptual and logical model for the exchange
of groundwater data, as well as a GML/XML encoding with examples.
----

==== Preface

===== General

The "`Preface`" can be specified in two ways, depending on whether
it is a "`simple clause`", or a "`full clause`".

===== Simple preface clause

If the "`Preface`" does not contain subclauses, it is considered
a simple preface clause.

A simple preface clause is entered as text after the `.Preface` label,
placed between the AsciiDoc document attributes and the first AsciiDoc
section title. It should not be given a section title of its own.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

.Preface

Your preface text...

More preface text...
----

[[ogc-full-preface]]
===== Full preface clause

If the "`Preface`" contains subclauses, it needs to be encoded as
a full preface clause.

A full preface clause is recognized as a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section, with the
title "`Preface`". Simple preface content can also be encoded this way.
\[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.1]

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

== Preface

Your preface text...

=== Preface sub-clause

More preface text...
----


==== Keywords

"`Keywords`" are entered as document attributes as `:keywords:`, with the
value as a comma-delimited list.

Prefatory text is generated automatically.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
:keywords: ogcdoc, OGC document, groundwater, hydrogeology, GWML2
----

==== Security Considerations

The Security Considerations section is entered as a clause with the title "`Security Considerations`"

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Security Considerations

The following security considerations apply...
----

If the Security Considerations are not provided in the source document, the clause is inserted with the text
"`No security considerations have been made for this standard.`"

==== Submitting Organizations

"`Submitting Organizations`" are entered using the `:submitting-organizations:` document attribute.
The values are entered using a semi-colon delimited list.

Prefatory text is generated automatically.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
:submitting-organizations: Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), Canada; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), United States of America
----


==== Submitters

"`Submitters`" are entered using a table, contained in a section with the title `Submitters`.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Submitters

|===
|Name |Affiliation |OGC member

|Steve Liang | University of Calgary, Canada / SensorUp Inc. | Yes
|===
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Submitters

All questions regarding this submission should be directed to the editor or the submitters:

|===
|Name |Affiliation

|Boyan Brodaric |GSC
|Alexander Kmoch |U Salzburg
|===
----


[[ogc-additional-prelim]]
==== Additional preliminary elements

The OGC DocTeam has specified that additional preliminary elements are *allowed*
but not *encouraged*. This is useful for document backwards-compatibility and
cross-published standards at other SDOs.

Additional preliminary elements should be encoded under the `[.preface]` element,
and they will be rendered *after* the five mandatory preliminary elements.

Functionality implemented in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/issues/83.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
.Preface

...

[.preface]
== Intended audience

...

----


=== Examples

Unlike the normal case in Metanorma, examples can have captions:

[source,asciidoc]

----

=== Recommendations, requirements, and permissions

In this clause we will use the term "`requirement`" to refer to the
generic class of recommendations, requirements and permissions.

NOTE: This subsection supplements
link:/author/topics/document-format/requirements[Requirement, Recommendation, and Permission blocks]
in general Metanorma documentation.

==== Requirement verifications (tests)

A requirement with `type=verification` is cross-referenced and captioned as
a "`{Requirement} Test`". It is rendered differently from the
actual requirement itself.

NOTE: Verifications for Recommendations will be captioned as
Recommendation Tests, similarly for Requirement Tests and
Permission Tests.

Requirement verifications are excluded from the
"`Table of Requirements`" in Word output
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v0.2.10].

A requirement with `type=abstracttest` is cross-referenced and captioned as
an "Abstract Test", and is otherwise rendered identically to a
Requirement Verification [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.4].

==== Requirement classes

A requirement with `type=class` is cross-referenced and captioned as
a "`{Requirement} Class`", and is rendered differently to the actual
requirement itself
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v0.2.11].

NOTE: Classes for Recommendations will be captioned as
Recommendation Classes, similarly for Requirement Classes and
Permission Classes.

Requirement Classes must use the following Metanorma Requirement attributes:

* Target Type. Specified in the `subject` attribute.
* Name. Specified as the requirement's title.
* Dependencies (optional). Specified with the `inherit` attribute (which can take multiple semicolon-delimited values).
* Nesting (optional). Requirements contained in a class are presented as nested requirements.

A requirement with `type=conformanceclass` is cross-referenced and captioned as
a "Conformance Class", and is otherwise rendered identically to a
Requirement Class [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.4].

==== Rendering requirements

NOTE: In order to match the Metanorma encoding of requirements to existing OGC
AsciiDoc markup of requirements, users can refer to the rendering of Metanorma
requirements which is aligned the existing, tabular OGC encoding of
requirements.

An OGC requirement is rendered as follows:

* It is a table

* The CSS class of the requirement table is the `type` attribute of the
requirement.
+
The only types recognised are:

** `verification`,
** `abstracttest`,
** `class`,
** `conformanceclass`, and
** `recommend` (default).

* The heading of the table (spanning two columns) is its name (the AsciiDoc role
or style of the requirement, e.g. `[.permission] or [permission]`), optionally
followed by its title (the caption of the requirement, e.g. `.Title`).

* The title of the table (spanning two columns) is its `label` attribute.

* The initial rows of the body of the table are:

** The `obligation` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Obligation_
followed by the attribute value

** The `subject` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Target Type_ (for
Class or Conformance Class requirement) or _Subject_, followed by the attribute
value

** The `inherit` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Dependency_ followed
by the attribute value

** The `component` components of the requirement [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.3.8].
These are divided into three categories:

*** Components with the `class` attribute `conditions`, `test-purpose`, or `test-method`
are extrcted and presented in that order, as _Conditions_, _Test Purpose_ and
_Test Method_, followed by the component contents.

*** Components with the `class` attribute `part` are extracted and presented in order:
each Part is rendered as an incrementing capital letter (_A_, _B_, _C_ and so on),
followed by the component contents.

*** Other `class` attribute values are not currently supported.

** The `classification` attributes of the requirement, if given: the
classification tag (in capitals), followed by the classification value.

* The remaining rows of the requirement are the remaining components of the requirement,
encoded as table rows instead of as a definition table (as they are by default
in Metanorma).

** Components can include nested requirements; these are expected in the class
of Class and Conformance Class requirements.

** Components can include descriptive text.

** Components can include open blocks marked with role attributes.
+
The components recognized are:

*** `[.specification]`
*** `[.measurement-target]`
*** `[.verification]`
*** `[.import]`
*** `[.component]`, as discussed above: `[.component,class=conditions]`, `[.component,class=test-purpose]`,
`[.component,class=test-method]`, `[.component,class=part]`
*** Other component classes are not currently supported.

So the following recommendation class:

==== Legacy Metanorma AsciiDoc syntax

For legacy reasons, a second Metanorma AsciiDoc syntax is permitted for
recommendations, requirements and permissions.

In this syntax, Metanorma AsciiDoc tables are used to express the
data needed for requirements:

* Type of requirement. Specified in the first table cell,
  one of `Recommendation`, `Requirement` or `Permission`.
  Optionally followed by a number
  (which is ignored in parsing; the elements are renumbered
  automatically in rendering.)
* Internal label. First paragraph of the second table cell.
* Body of requirement. Second and subsequent paragraphs of the second table cell.

[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[[recommendation1]]
|===
|Recommendation |/ogc/recommendation/wfs/2 +

If the API definition document uses the OpenAPI Specification 3.0,
the document SHOULD conform to the
