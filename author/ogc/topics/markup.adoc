= Metanorma for OGC markup

== General

The rendering of OGC documents has changed over the years. Metanorma formats OGC documents
following current practice:

* All body text is left justified, with no exceptions allowed.

* Where section obligations are named (i.e. in annex names), they are only given
  as "`normative`" or "`informative`"; the alternate text of "`non-normative`" is
  disallowed.

* Ordered lists follow ISO style numbering, i.e. "`a), b), c) ...`", with no
  exceptions allowed.

== Inline formatting

Metanorma-OGC supports highlighting of text [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.2.16]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
This is #text to be highlighted#.
----

== Sections

=== References 

The Normative References section may be named just "`References`", reflecting
OGC practice.

== Preliminary sections

=== General

The following clauses are preliminary elements, and are moved into the
frontispiece of the document (in Metanorma, the "`document preface`").

The https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/docteam[OGC DocTeam] has specified that
all these elements are *MANDATORY* in OGC documents (in this order):

* Abstract
* Keywords
* Preface
* Security Considerations [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.2.5]
* Submitting Organizations
* Submitters

The Foreword and Introduction are not recognised as part of the document preface
by default [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.2].

[NOTE]
--
Additional preliminary sections are *allowed* but not encouraged.
There are two mechanisms for adding additional content as preliminary elements:

. Add their content in the <<ogc-full-preface,Full Preface>> as additional sub-sections
. Add them as <<ogc-additional-prelim,additional preliminary elements>>
--

=== Abstract

The abstract is recognized as the first clause with an `abstract` style
attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[abstract]
== Abstract

This standard describes a conceptual and logical model for the exchange
of groundwater data, as well as a GML/XML encoding with examples.
----

=== Preface

==== General

The "`Preface`" can be specified in two ways, depending on whether
it is a "`simple clause`", or a "`full clause`".

==== Simple preface clause

If the "`Preface`" does not contain subclauses, it is considered
a simple preface clause.

A simple preface clause is entered as text after the `.Preface` label,
placed between the AsciiDoc document attributes and the first AsciiDoc
section title. It should not be given a section title of its own.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

.Preface

Your preface text...

More preface text...
----

[[ogc-full-preface]]
==== Full preface clause

If the "`Preface`" contains subclauses, it needs to be encoded as
a full preface clause.

A full preface clause is recognized as a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section, with the
title "`Preface`". Simple preface content can also be encoded this way.
\[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.1]

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

== Preface

Your preface text...

=== Preface sub-clause

More preface text...
----


=== Keywords

"`Keywords`" are entered as document attributes as `:keywords:`, with the
value as a comma-delimited list.

Prefatory text is generated automatically.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
:keywords: ogcdoc, OGC document, groundwater, hydrogeology, GWML2
----

=== Security Considerations

The Security Considerations section is entered as a clause with the title
"`Security Considerations`".

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Security Considerations

The following security considerations apply...
----

If the Security Considerations are not provided in the source document, the
clause is inserted with the text "`No security considerations have been made for
this standard.`"


=== Submitting Organizations

"`Submitting Organizations`" are entered using the `:submitting-organizations:`
document attribute.

The values are entered using a semi-colon delimited list.

Prefatory text is generated automatically.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
:submitting-organizations: Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), Canada; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), United States of America
----


=== Submitters

"`Submitters`" are entered using a table, contained in a section with the title "`Submitters`".

NOTE: Any table included in a Submitters section is automatically
unnumbered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.1]

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Submitters

|===
|Name |Affiliation |OGC member

|Steve Liang | University of Calgary, Canada / SensorUp Inc. | Yes
|===
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Submitters

All questions regarding this submission should be directed to the editor or the
submitters:

|===
|Name |Affiliation

|Boyan Brodaric |GSC
|Alexander Kmoch |U Salzburg
|===
----


[[ogc-additional-prelim]]
=== Additional preliminary elements

The OGC DocTeam has specified that additional preliminary elements are *allowed*
but not *encouraged*. This is useful for document backwards-compatibility and
cross-published standards at other SDOs.

Additional preliminary elements should be encoded under the `[.preface]`
element, and they will be rendered *after* the five mandatory preliminary
elements.

Functionality implemented in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/issues/83.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
.Preface

...

[.preface]
== Intended audience

...

----

=== Glossary

A glossary in an OGC document is an annex with the same content as a
"`Terms and definitions`" section, but with informative rather than normative
effect. 

Glossaries are recognised as annexes with the title "`Glossary`", or marked up
with `[heading=glossary]` [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
[appendix]
== Glossary

=== geospatial

relating to geographic and spatial information

[.source]
<<OGC21-017,clause="4.3">>
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
[appendix,heading=glossary]
== Customized glossary section

=== geospatial

relating to geographic and spatial information

[.source]
<<OGC21-017,clause="4.3">>
----

== Blocks

=== Examples

Unlike the normal case in Metanorma, examples can have captions:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[example]
.Example caption
====
Text
====
----

=== Tables

Table cells under OGC always have a vertical alignment of `middle` [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.1]. Any
markup instructions to set cell alignment to a different vertical alignment
are ignored.


=== Remove numbering

Almost any block that receive a numbering sequence can be unnumbered via `[%unnumbered]` attribute. +
Specifically figures, examples, equations, sources and tables.

In principle, we can prepend `[%unnumbered]` attribute to the block to get it out from the numbering sequence:

.Remove numbering of blocks by prepending `[%unnumbered]` attribute
[source]
--
// Unnumbered figure
[%unnumbered]
image::images/fig1.png[]

// Unnumbered example
[%unnumbered]
[example]
Example content

// Unnumbered equation
[%unnumbered]
[stem]
++++
x = y + z
++++

// Unnumbered source
[%unnumbered]
[source,json]
----
{
  "title": "Buildings in Bonn",
  "description": "Access to data about buildings in the city of Bonn via a Web API."
}
----

// Unnumbered table
[%unnumbered]
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| header 1 | header 2
| cell 1 | cell 2
|===
--


Now, there is a more esthetic way to apply this attribute.

Depending of the block, we can append `%unnumbered` to the name of the block and get the same result, e.g.: +
`[example%unnumbered]`, `[stem%unnumbered,json]`, etc.

For tables, we can add `unnumbered` attribute as an option, e.g.: `[cols="...",options="header,unnumbered"]`

So:

.Remove numbering of blocks by appending `%unnumbered` attribute
[source]
--
// Unnumbered example
[example%unnumbered]
Example content

// Unnumbered equation
[stem%unnumbered]
++++
x = y + z
++++

// Unnumbered source
[source%unnumbered,json]
----
{
  "title": "Buildings in Bonn",
  "description": "Access to data about buildings in the city of Bonn via a Web API."
}
----

// Unnumbered table
[cols="2",options="header,unnumbered"]
|===
| header 1 | header 2
| cell 1 | cell 2
|===
--

As a rule of thumb, if you are not sure how to (esthetically) remove the numbering of a certain block, just prepend `[%unnumbered]` to it. It works for any block that supports `unnumbered` attribute.
