= Metanorma for OGC markup

== General

The rendering of OGC documents has changed over the years. Metanorma formats OGC documents
following current practice:

* All body text is left justified, with no exceptions allowed.

* Where section obligations are named (i.e. in annex names), they are only given
  as "`normative`" or "`informative`"; the alternate text of "`non-normative`" is
  disallowed.

* Ordered lists follow ISO style numbering, i.e. "`a), b), c) ...`", with no
  exceptions allowed.

== Inline formatting

Metanorma-OGC supports highlighting of text [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.2.16]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
This is #text to be highlighted#.
----

== Sections


=== References

The Normative References section can be named just "`References`", reflecting
OGC practice.


=== Terms and definitions

==== General

The "Terms and definitions" clause for current OGC documents adhere mostly to
the link:/author/iso/topics/markup/#terms-and-definitions[ISO terms and definitions]
practices.

An OGC "Terms and definitions" section can be specified in the following ways:

* Standalone terms and definitions
* Combined terms, definitions and symbols
* Combined terms, definitions and abbreviated terms
* Combined terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms

NOTE: The combined clauses feature is similar to that of the
link:/author/iso/topics/markup/#combined-terms-and-definitions[ISO combined terms and definitions]
clauses.

NOTE: This section supplements
link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms[Terms and definitions] in
general Metanorma documentation.

==== Standalone terms and definitions

If the clause contains only terms and definitions.
The clause title will be set to "`__Terms and definitions__`".

.Markup of simple "Terms and definitions" clause
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== term 1
...

=== term 2
...
----
====

==== Combined terms, definitions and symbols

If the clause contains terms and definitions, together with
a list of symbols.

The clause title will be set to "`__Terms, definitions and symbols__`".

.Markup of "Terms and definitions" clause with symbols
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms, definitions and symbols

=== Terms and definitions

==== term 1

...

==== term 2
...

=== Symbols

stem:[x + y]:: Notation one
stem:[x - y]:: Notation two
...
----
====

==== Combined terms, definitions and abbreviated terms

If the clause contains terms and definitions, together with
a list of abbreviated terms.

The clause title will be set to "`__Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms__`".

.Markup of "Terms and definitions" clause with abbreviated terms
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms

=== Terms and definitions

==== term 1

...

==== term 2
...

=== Abbreviated terms

OGC:: Open Geospatial Consortium
ISO:: International Organisation for Standardisation
...
----
====

==== Combined terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms

If the clause contains a subclause named "Terms and definitions", "Symbols"
and "Abbreviated terms", then the clause title will be set to
"`__Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms__`".

.Markup of "Terms and definitions" clause with symbols and abbreviated terms
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms

=== Terms and definitions

==== term 1

Definition 1

==== term 2

Definition 2

=== Symbols

stem:[x + y]:: Notation one
stem:[x - y]:: Notation two
...

=== Abbreviated terms

OGC:: Open Geospatial Consortium
ISO:: International Organisation for Standardisation
...

----
====

NOTE: Section titles are rendered in sentence-case, i.e. only the first letter
of the first word is capitalized.


==== Modifying introductory text in "Terms and definitions"

A default OGC introductory text is inserted at the beginning of the clause in
accordance to OGC policies.

As described in
link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/[generic terms and definitions]
documentation, this text can be overridden by using the `[.boilerplate]`
attribute applied to the first subclause.

.Overriding introductory content in the "Terms and definitions" section
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
=== My predefined text

Predefined content that overwrites the default one taking into
account that:

* The title "My predefined text" will not be shown in the output.
* This practice does not follow OGC requirements.
----
====


==== Adding an informative glossary

OGC documents are allowed to contain an informative "Glossary" as an appendix.
This section is to contain terms and definitions that are purely of informative
content, for example, terms imported from other documents meant only for illustration purposes.

The "Glossary" appendix does not support symbols, abbreviations or other
sections. Only terms and definitions are allowed.

The "Glossary" appendix can be created as follows.

.Markup structure of a Glossary appendix containing terms and definitions
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix,obligation="informative"]
== Glossary

=== term 1
...

=== term 2
...
----
====

These terms will be rendered in the same format as in the
"Terms and definitions" clause.


== Preliminary sections

=== General

The following clauses are preliminary elements, and are moved into the
frontispiece of the document (in Metanorma, the "`document preface`").

The https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/docteam[OGC DocTeam] has specified that
all these elements are *MANDATORY* in OGC documents (in this order):

* Abstract
* Keywords
* Preface
* Security Considerations [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.2.5]
* Submitting Organizations
* Submitters

The Foreword and Introduction are not recognised as part of the document preface
by default [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.2].

[NOTE]
--
Additional preliminary sections are *allowed* but not encouraged.
There are two mechanisms for adding additional content as preliminary elements:

. Add their content in the <<ogc-preface,Full Preface>> as additional sub-sections
. Add them as <<ogc-additional-prelim,additional preliminary elements>>
--

=== Abstract

The abstract is recognized as the first clause with an `abstract` style
attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[abstract]
== Abstract

This standard describes a conceptual and logical model for the exchange
of groundwater data, as well as a GML/XML encoding with examples.
----

[[ogc-preface]]
=== Preface

A preface clause is recognized as a full section, with the title "`Preface`".
The Preface clause may contain subclauses.
\[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.1]

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

== Preface

Your preface text...

=== Preface sub-clause

More preface text...
----

NOTE: Previously, the Preface section can be specified by text entered after a
`.Preface` label, which has to be placed between the AsciiDoc document
attributes and the first AsciiDoc section title.
This behavior is now deprecated in favor of specifying the Preface as a real
section to allow better reflection of content order.

=== Keywords

"`Keywords`" are entered as document attributes as `:keywords:`, with the
value as a comma-delimited list.

Prefatory text is generated automatically.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
:keywords: ogcdoc, OGC document, groundwater, hydrogeology, GWML2
----

=== Security Considerations

The Security Considerations section is entered as a clause with the title
"`Security Considerations`".

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Security Considerations

The following security considerations apply...
----

If the Security Considerations are not provided in the source document, the
clause is inserted with the text "`No security considerations have been made for
this standard.`"


=== Submitting Organizations

"`Submitting Organizations`" are entered using the `:submitting-organizations:`
document attribute.

The values are entered using a semi-colon delimited list.

Prefatory text is generated automatically.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
:submitting-organizations: Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), Canada; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), United States of America
----


=== Submitters

"`Submitters`" are entered using a table, contained in a section with the title "`Submitters`".

NOTE: Any table included in a Submitters section is automatically
unnumbered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.1]

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Submitters

|===
|Name |Affiliation |OGC member

|Steve Liang | University of Calgary, Canada / SensorUp Inc. | Yes
|===
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Submitters

All questions regarding this submission should be directed to the editor or the
submitters:

|===
|Name |Affiliation

|Boyan Brodaric |GSC
|Alexander Kmoch |U Salzburg
|===
----


[[ogc-additional-prelim]]
=== Additional preliminary elements

The OGC DocTeam has specified that additional preliminary elements are *allowed*
but not *encouraged*. This is useful for document backwards-compatibility and
cross-published standards at other SDOs.

Additional preliminary elements should be encoded under the `[.preface]`
element, and they will be rendered *after* the five mandatory preliminary
elements.

Functionality implemented in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/issues/83.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
== Preface

...

[.preface]
== Intended audience

...

----

=== Glossary

A glossary in an OGC document is an annex with the same content as a
"`Terms and definitions`" section, but with informative rather than normative
effect.

Glossaries are recognised as annexes with the title "`Glossary`", or marked up
with `[heading=glossary]` [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
[appendix]
== Glossary

=== geospatial

relating to geographic and spatial information

[.source]
<<OGC21-017,clause="4.3">>
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
[appendix,heading=glossary]
== Customized glossary section

=== geospatial

relating to geographic and spatial information

[.source]
<<OGC21-017,clause="4.3">>
----

== Blocks

=== Example blocks

Unlike typical Metanorma, examples can have captions:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[example]
.Example caption
====
Text
====
----

=== Table blocks

Table cells under OGC always have a vertical alignment of `middle` [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

Any markup instructions to set cell alignment to a different vertical alignment
are ignored.


=== Unnumbered blocks

In Metanorma for OGC, all block elements are auto-numbered in order to
facilitate unique referencing.

Each block label is unique and typically composed of the block type with a
sequence number. For instance, "`Table 3`" or "`Figure 5`".

In some cases, the author may want to remove the unique label and the numbering
applied to a block, for example, when inserting short source code blocks
within text that have no need of being uniquely referenced.

All auto-numbered blocks can be marked to not be labelled via the `unnumbered`
attribute option.

These block types include:

* Figure
* Example
* Equation
* Source code
* Table

The `unnumbered` attribute can be used in the following ways, in equal effect.

For blocks without the explicit block type defined, prepend with the
`[%unnumbered]` attribute right before the block definition.

[example]
====
.Unnumbered figure using "[%unnumbered]"
[source]
--
[%unnumbered]
image::images/fig1.png[]
--
====

[example]
====
.Unnumbered example using "[%unnumbered]"
[source]
--
[%unnumbered]
[example]
Example content
--
====

[example]
====
.Unnumbered equation using "[%unnumbered]"
[source]
--
[%unnumbered]
[stem]
++++
x = y + z
++++
--
====

[example]
====
.Unnumbered source using "[%unnumbered]"
[source]
--
[%unnumbered]
[source,json]
----
{
  "title": "Buildings in city",
  "description": "Access to data about buildings in the city via a Web API."
}
----
--
====

[example]
====
.Unnumbered table using "[%unnumbered]"
[source]
--
[%unnumbered]
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| header 1 | header 2
| cell 1 | cell 2
|===
--
====

For blocks with their types defined explicitly that do not have the `options`
attribute list, insert "%unnumbered" right after the block type, before
the block type separator, e.g.: `[example%unnumbered]`, `[stem%unnumbered]`, etc.

[example]
====
.Unnumbered example by appending "%unnumbered" to block type
[source]
--
[example%unnumbered]
Example content
--
====

[example]
====
.Unnumbered equation by appending "%unnumbered" to block type
[source]
--
[stem%unnumbered]
++++
x = y + z
++++
--
====

[example]
====
.Unnumbered source by appending "%unnumbered" to block type
[source]
--
[source%unnumbered,json]
----
{
  "title": "Buildings in city",
  "description": "Access to data about buildings in the city via a Web API."
}
----
--
====

For tables, we can add the `unnumbered` attribute as an option,
e.g.: `[cols="...",options="header,unnumbered"]`

[example]
====
.Unnumbered table by adding "unnumbered" in the "options" attribute list
[source]
--
[cols="2",options="header,unnumbered"]
|===
| header 1 | header 2
| cell 1 | cell 2
|===
--
====

As a rule of thumb, if you are unsure how to remove the numbering of a block,
just prepend `[%unnumbered]` to it. It works for any block that supports
the `unnumbered` attribute.
