= Metanorma for OGC document attributes

== Document type and stage

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ogc]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of OGC documents in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma authorâ€™s documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just OGC.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

Comma-delimited list of the keywords associated with the document.

[NOTE]
--
Abbreviations are sometimes used to designate that a document has a
certain document type, document subtype and document stage.
This is a mapping from legacy OGC document values to the current normalized
list:

"`AS`" Abstract Specification:: Now `:doctype: abstract-specification-topic`.
"`BP`" Best Practice:: Now `:doctype: best-practice`.
"`CAN`" Candidate Standard:: Now `:doctype: standard` and `:docstage: swg-draft`.
"`CC`" Conformance Class:: Not a standalone document, but a part of a document with `:doctype: standard`. No longer exists.
"`CR`" Change Request:: Now `:doctype: change-request-supporting-document`; the actual Change Request is a database entry.
"`CS`" Community Standard:: Now `:doctype: community-standard`.
"`CP`" Community Practice:: Now `:doctype: community-practice`.
"`DP`" Discussion Paper:: Now `:doctype: discussion-paper`.
"`DP-Draft`" Draft Discussion Paper:: Now `:doctype: discussion-paper` with `:docstage: swg-draft`.

== Author info

`:committee:`::
*Mandatory.*
Name of relevant committee producing the document. Use one of:
+
--
* `technical`: Technical Committee
* `planning`: Planning Committee
* `strategic-member-advisory`: Strategic Member Advisory Committee
--

`:subcommittee-type:`::
The type of the relevant subcommittee producing the document.

`:subcommittee-number:`::
The number of the relevant subcommittee producing the document.

`:workingGroup:`::
*Mandatory.*
Name of relevant working group producing the document.

`:workgroup-type:`::
Type of the relevant workgroup producing the document.

`:workgroup-number:`::
Number of the relevant workgroup producing the document.

`:submitting-organizations:`::
Semicolon-delimited list of the submitting organizations
for this document. The organization names themselves may contain commas.
+
[example]
--
EXAMPLE: _University of Calgary, Canada; National Central University, Taiwan_
--

`:editor:`::
Same as `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#fullname[:fullname:]`
alongside `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#role[:role:]` specified as `editor`.


== URIs and IDs

`:external-id:`::
External identifier referring to this document. If not supplied, a default value is
generated: `http://www.opengis.net/doc/{abbrevation of doctype}/{abbrev}/{version}`.
(Version is omitted if not provided. If `:abbrev:` and `:doctype:` are not provided,
the default value is not generated.

`:referenceURLID:`::
Identifier embedded into a document type-specific external URL.

`:previous-uri:`::
URI of previous version of the document.

`:docnumber:`::
The document number assigned to the OGC document (without the "`OGC`" prefix). +
+
The number is formulated following the following rules:
+
* The final two digits of the year are used at the start of the number (`YY`).
* A three digit number is assigned sequentially for each document in the year (`NNN`).
* The first edition of a document has the document number `YY-NNN`; for example, `00-027` is OGC document 027 first published in 2000.
* Minor editorial changes and corrigenda do not result in a change to the document number
* The `YY-NNN` identifier for a document (the document number root) is maintained if the document undergoes content changes (revisions). These revisions are numbered sequentially, and are indicated with `r` followed by the revision number. So `05-020r27` is revision 27 of OGC document 020 first published in 2005. (Revision 27 may appear years later than 2005.)
* A new major version of a document receives a new document number, including likely a new year.

== Mapping to OGC legacy AsciiDoc

Metanorma-OGC permits legacy OGC AsciiDoc template attributes,
and are treated as synonyms of the corresponding Metanorma attributes:

|===
| OGC Metanorma AsciiDoc                    | OGC legacy AsciiDoc

| `:copyright-year:`                        | `:copyrightYear`
| `:workgroup:`                             | `:workingGroup:`
| `:published-date:`                        | `:publicationDate:`
| `:issued-date:`                           | `:approvalDate:`
| `:received-date:`                         | `:submissionDate:`
| `:docnumber:`                             | `:docReference:`
| `:fullname:`, with `:role:` = `editor`    | `:editor:`
| `:edition:`                               | `:version:`
