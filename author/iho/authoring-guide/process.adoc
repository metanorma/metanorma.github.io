title: IHO deliverable development process
---

The process of developing an IHO deliverable is best described in the official
https://standards.iho.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/other/iho_sa_toolkit.pdf[IHO Quick Reference Guide: Standards Development Process],
which summarizes the following two documents:

* https://standards.iho.org/about/policies/bylaws/index.html[IHO Standards Board Bylaws]
* https://standards.iho.org/about/policies/opman/index.html[IHO Standards Board Operation Manual]

The following information is excerpted from the Reference Guide as a simple
summary for editors. For official information, please refer to the official
IHO sources.

When initiating a new IHO project (which produces an IHO deliverable),
the following steps are taken:

. PAR approval. The initiating group submits a Project Authorization Request
(PAR) to the New Standards Committee (NesCom). NesCom reviews PARs then makes a
recommendation to the IHO Standards Board (SASB) as to whether or not the
project should be approved. Once approved by the SASB, the PAR is the official
document that authorizes work on a standards development project in IHO. +

There are three types of deliverables produced by IHO, including:

** Standards: deliverables with mandatory requirements

** Recommended practices: deliverables in which procedures and positions
preferred by IHO are presented.

** Guides: deliverables in which alternative approaches to good practice are
suggested but no clear-cut recommendations are made.

. WG formation. A Working Group (WG) is formed by interested parties for the
purpose of creating the deliverable. A working group is commonly named according
to some number, such as "2874". +

There are two types of working group participation methods allowed in IHO,
namely:

** Entity-based: WG membership is comprised of entities that are IHO
Corporate Members. These are usually companies, universities, government
agencies, or organizations. Each entity has one vote each and appoint designated
representatives to the WG.

** Individual-based: WG membership is comprised of individual technical experts,
which do not need to be IHO members. Each individual holds one vote.

. WG drafting. The WG creates an IHO deliverable draft and iterates the
following process until it is approved via ballot. At each drafting iteration,
the draft identifier typically holds the pattern of "P{wg-number}/D{draft-number}",
where the draft number is follows an increasing sequence of "D1", "D2", etc.

.. WG drafting. The WG develops and refines the draft. At this stage IHO
provides the following resources:

*** https://mentor.iho.org/myproject/Public/mytools/draft/styleman.pdf[IHO Standards Style Manual].
Drafts are required to adhere to the requirements stated here.

*** IHO editorial support. IHO has a professional staff of editors who
offer https://standards.iho.org/faqs/copyrights/index.html[guidance].

*** Mandatory editorial coordination (MEC). Before WG ballot, it is necessary
to complete a MEC review and have the necessary changes incorporated.

.. WG internal approval. Once the WG reached consensus that a draft "Dn" is
sufficiently complete, the WG determines whether the draft has gained WG
approval. Once the draft gains WG approval, it will proceed to SC approval.

. SC approval. Once the WG and Standards Committee (SC) reach consensus
that the draft standard is complete, the consensus balloting process (Standards
Association (SA) ballot) can begin. One or more recirculation ballots may be
required to resolve the SA ballot comments received.

. RevCom recommendation. Upon approval at the SA ballot, the draft standard
is submitted to the Standards Review Committee (RevCom). RevCom ensures that
procedural requirements of the IHO have been met and makes a recommendation
to the IHO Standards Board (SASB) whether or not the draft standard should
be approved as an IHO standard. See
https://standards.iho.org/about/sasb/revcom/meetings.html[RevCom Conventions and Guidelines].

. SASB approval. After a standards project is approved by the SASB, the IHO
editor prepares the standard for publication, working in conjunction with the
WG Chair and/or Technical Editor.

. Publication. When editing is deemed complete by the SA editor and WG Chair
and/or Technical Editor, the deliverable is published.

. Maintenance. All IHO standards have to undergo and complete a revision
process within ten years from the approval year to retain active standard
status. WGs may initiate a revision sooner than ten years.
