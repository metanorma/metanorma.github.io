// Include 1: inline_markup.adoc

To annotate single words, use inline markup. The markup encloses the word(s)
and you do not need to begin a new line.

Inline markup allows you to:

* Emphasize text
* Link to external resources with hyperlinks
* Create internal cross-references
* Create index entries
* Create Bibliographic entries


== Text markup

// Include 2: text_formatting.adoc
=== General text markup

The simplest form of inline markup is to emphasize text. typical AsciiDoc allows
you to:

* *Bold* text by wrapping text with asterisks (`*`)
* _Italicise_ words by wrapping text with underscores (`_`)
* Apply `monospace` formatting by wrapping text with backticks
* Superscript and subscript characters (like CO~2~ or x^4^)

*bold*
_italic_
`monospace`

~subscript~

Metanorma extends these simple formats with:

* Strikethrough text ([strike]#strike through text#)
* Smallcaps text ([smallcap]#small caps text#)
* Underline text ([underline]#underline text#)

//Include 4: text_formatting.adoc
== Character substitutions

Metanorma supports automatic character replacements, for example the
copyright symbol Â© can be entered using `(C)`.

Metanorma also recognizes HTML and XML character references, as well as decimal
and hexadecimal Unicode code points.

NOTE: For more information about automatic character replacements, see
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/subs/replacements/[AsciiDoc documentation].


//Inlcude 5: footnotes.adoc
== Footnotes

=== General

Footnotes are a great option to add a remark to your content without disturbing
reading flow.

In standards however, footnotes are discouraged as they hide potentially
important information in the footer. It also becomes unclear whether the
footnote is normative or informative in nature.

=== Single-line footnotes

Footnotes can be added to the document using the footnote command
(`footnote:[]`).

Just add the footnote where you want it to appear, like this:

[source,adoc]
----
Oryza sativa footnote:[Sativa means "cultivated"], is rice that is farmed
commercially.
----


=== Multi-paragraph footnotes

Metanorma provides the footnote command `footnoteblock:[id]` which allows
multi-paragraph notes to be treated as footnotes.

Multi-paragraph footnotes can be entered using the command
`footnoteblock:[id]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.4],
where `id` is the identifier of a note containing the contents of the footnote.

.Example of a multi-paragraph footnote
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
This is a paragraph.footnoteblock:[id1] This continues the paragraph.

[[id]]
[NOTE]
--
This is

a multi-paragraph

NOTE: The popular AsciiDoc processor, Asciidoctor, supports only
single-paragraph footnotes through its `footnote` command (which can only
contain a single line of text).
