== Document attributes

[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma's processing of IHO documents.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just IHO.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

== Markup

=== Annexes

Appendixes are annexes marked as informative instead of normative, which is the default.

Appendixes are numbered
with Arabic numerals rather than letters, as a separate sequence from normative Annexes.

[source,asciidoc]

[appendix,obligation=normative]
== First Annex

[appendix,obligation=informative]
== First Appendix
--

renders as

____
*Annex A*

*First Annex*

(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation)

*Appendix 1*

*First Appendix*

(This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation)
____

In addition, Annexes can have their own appendixes; this means supplementary clauses
to the annex, rather than informative clauses within the annex. Appendices to annexes
are marked up with an option attribute of "appendix":
