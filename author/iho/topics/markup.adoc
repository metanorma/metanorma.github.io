== Clause structure

IHO M-3, "Principles and procedures for making changes to IHO technical
standards and specifications" (2/2007 as amended) is the general requirement
document for IHO publications.

While IHO does not have stringent requirements for the internal structure of its
publications, there is a general "best practice" pattern as derived from modern
IHO publications.

NOTE: This pattern is derived from IHO S-102.

* Preface segments
** Document History

* 1. Overview
** 1.1. Introduction
** 1.2. References
** 1.3 Terms, definitions and abbreviations
** 1.3.1 Use of language
** 1.3.2 Terms and definitions
** 1.3.3 Abbreviations
** 1.4 Publication metadata (abstract, title, change procedures etc.)

* 2 and onwards. Document content.
* Annex A onwards. Document content.

=== Automatic generated content

The templated material ("boilerplate") of the document front matter is all
automatically provided by Metanorma:

* Cover page: IHO contact information.

* Inner cover: Copyright statement.


[[participants]]
== Participants and contributors

=== General

An IHO publication is typically created by a working group that belongs to a
committee.

Please refer to the
link:/author/iho/ref/document-attributes#document-contributors[document attributes on document contributors],
on how they are specified.

=== Committee

Metanorma supports IHO publications developed under two committees:

* https://iho.int/en/hssc[HSSC]. The Hydrographic Services and Standards Programme (Programme 2 of the IHO Work Programme).
* https://iho.int/en/ircc[IRCC]. The Inter-Regional Coordination Committee (Programme 3 of the IHO Work Programme).


=== Working group

Under the IHO committees, there are many regional bodies or working group, or sub-working groups.
All these groups are considered "working groups" in Metanorma.

Please refer to the full list at the respective committee sites:
* https://iho.int/en/hssc[HSSC]
* https://iho.int/en/ircc[IRCC]


// end::preliminary-iho[]


== Overview

=== General

The _Overview_ clause, and its subclauses are recognized automatically from the
supplied clause headers.

The subclauses recognized include:

* _Introduction_
* _References_
* _Terms, definitions and abbreviations_

=== Introduction

The introduction of the document is marked up as a clause with the title
"Introduction" within "Overview".


=== References

The introductory paragraph for normative references and bibliographies is
automatically generated by Metanorma.

References are automatically sorted by Metanorma:

* Normative references are automatically sorted by designator.

* Bibliography references are automatically sorted by designators or author and
title.

[example]
.Example of References clause (S-102)
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[bibliography]
=== References
* [[[iho-s100,IHO S-100]]]

* [[[iho-s44,IHO S-44]]]

* [[[iho-s4,IHO S-4]]]
----
====


== Definitions clause

// tag::definitions[]

=== General

Definitions are recognised as a clause with the title "Definitions" or "Terms
and definitions".

Definitions are automatically sorted by Metanorma.

The notation for subdefinitions and cross-references in Metanorma is
demonstrated in the following example.

Metanorma supports _concepts_, which capture terms are cross-referencable
entities, including cross-references within the Definitions sections.

NOTE: Highlighting and cross-referencing of concepts is not supported in
Metanorma for IHO as they are not defined in IHO.


.Example with abbreviated term, multiple definitions and concept relations
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== widget
preferred:[WgT]
related:contrast[thing] // Contrast:
related:seealso[whatsit] // See also:

[.definition]
device performing an unspecified function.

[.definition]
general metasyntactic variable.
----

renders as:

____
*widget (WgT)*: *(A)* device performing an unspecified function. *(B)* general
metasyntactic variable. _See also:_ whatsit. _Contrast:_ thing.
____
====


=== Multiple definitions

IHO documents supports multiple definitions per term.

Each definition is encoded using the `[.definition]` block.

.Example with multiple definitions (IHO Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== output

[.definition]
Data that has been processed.

[.definition]
The process of transferring data from an internal storage device to an external
storage device.
----

renders as:

____
*output:* *(A)* Data that has been processed. *(B)* The process of transferring
data from an internal storage device to an external storage device.
____
====


=== Concept relations

==== Synonyms

Synonyms are entered using `preferred:[...]` or `admitted:[...]`.

A preferred term is intended to introduce equally valid term designations, such
as abbreviations and acronyms such as acronyms. Preferred terms are encoded
`+preferred[...]+`.
These are displayed in parentheses after the initial term.

An admitted term is intended for synonyms. Admitted terms are encoded using
`+admitted:[...]+`.
These are displayed using the concept relation _See:_, where an additional term
is automatically inserted into the clause.

NOTE: _See:_ terms are the opposite relations to _Syn:_ relations, and the
generated relation will point the _See:_ term's definition back at the original
term. Please _do not_ manually insert markup for _See:_ terms.

.Example of definition with _See:_ (IHO Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== coded character set
admitted:[code set]

A set of characters for which coded representation exist.
----

renders as:

____
*code set:* _See:_ *coded character set*.

*coded character set:* A set of characters for which coded representation exist.
_Syn:_ code set.
____
====

.Example of definition showing preferred abbreviation and admitted term as _See:_
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== widget
preferred:[WgT]
admitted:[doovywhack]

device performing an unspecified function.
----

renders as:

____
*doovywhack*: _See:_ widget.

*widget (WgT)*: device performing an unspecified function. _Syn:_ doovywhack.
____
====

==== Contrast

A contrasting term is one that describes an opposite meaning to the designated
definition.

.Term encoded with _Contrast:_ (IHO Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== input reference axis
related:contrast[output reference axis]

The direction of an axis as defined by the case mounting surfaces, external case
markings, or both.
----

renders as:

____
*input reference axis:* The direction of an axis as defined by the case mounting
surfaces, external case markings, or both. _Contrast:_ *output reference axis*.
____
====

==== See also

.Term encoded with _See also:_ (IHO Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== acceleration-insensitive drift rate
related:seealso[drift rate]
related:seealso[systematic drift rate]

The component of systematic drift rate that has no correlation with acceleration.
----

renders as:

____
*acceleration-insensitive drift rate:* The component of systematic drift rate
that has no correlation with acceleration. _See also:_ *drift rate*;
*systematic drift rate*.
____
====


==== Equivalence

An equivalent term is meant to cross-reference pre-existing term definitions.

Equivalent terms are encoded using the relation `related:equivalent[...]`.



=== Term sources

Term sources are encoded using the `[.source]` syntax, and rendered within
parentheses after the definition according to the IHO Style Manual.

.Example on encoding term source (IHO Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== systematic drift rate

That component of drift rate that is correlated with specific operating
conditions.

[.source]
<<IHO-260-1-2004>>
----

renders as:

____
*systematic drift rate*: That component of drift rate that is correlated with
specific operating conditions. (IHO Std 260.1-2004)
____
====

For terms that are modified or adapted from the source, they are encoded as
"adapted from" through an `adapted` option on the source tag.

.Example on encoding an adapted term source (IHO Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== drift rate

The slope at a stated time of the smoothed curve of tube voltage drop with time
at constant operating conditions.

[.source%adapted]
<<iso-iec_9945-1>>
----

rendered as

____
*drift rate:* The slope at a stated time of the smoothed curve of tube voltage
drop with time at constant operating conditions. (Adapted from ISO/IEC
9945-1:2003)
____
====

// end::definitions[]

== Annexes

Appendixes are annexes marked as informative instead of normative, which is the default.

Appendixes are numbered
with Arabic numerals rather than letters, as a separate sequence from normative Annexes.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[appendix,obligation=normative]
== First Annex

[appendix,obligation=informative]
== First Appendix
--

renders as

____
*Annex A*

*First Annex*

(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation)

*Appendix 1*

*First Appendix*

(This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation)
____

In addition, Annexes can have their own appendixes; this means supplementary clauses
to the annex, rather than informative clauses within the annex. Appendices to annexes
are marked up with an option attribute of "appendix":

[source,asciidoc]
--
[appendix]
== Annex A
Text

[%appendix]
=== Appendix 1
Text
--





== Blocks

=== Notes

The footnote on first appearance of a note,

____
Notes to text, tables, and figures are for information only and do not contain
requirements needed to implement the standard.
____

is automatically generated by Metanorma.

=== Tables

tag::tables-iho[]

Table heads and table subheads are marked up as header cells. They are differentiated by line break:

[source,asciidoc]
----
|===
| Header1 | Header2

h| Table Row Head +
Table Row Subhead | Value
----

end::tables-iho[]

// tag::inline-iho[]
== Inline

=== Cross-references

Omission of "clause" at the start of a sentence for cross-references to
subclauses is done automatically by Metanorma. If Metanorma's detection of the
start of a sentence is incorrect, you can override Metanorma's auto-generated
text, by providing it explicitly within the cross-reference, e.g.
`<<xref1,Clause 3.1>>`.

References to the bibliography are automatically populated by designator and bibliographic number (e.g. _ISO 639-2, [B1]_),
if the reference is to a standard or technical report, or otherwise by title and bibliographic number. If you wish to
override that, e.g. by using authors instead of title, you should populate the cross-reference text, e.g.
`<<ref1,Boswell and Johnson [B2]>>`.

=== Footnotes

If a footnote is repeated, Metanorma automatically detects that and converts it
into a cross-reference ("See Footnote 1.")

A repeat footnote can be marked up using the `footnote` macro target (`abc` in
the following example; any identifier can be used), and with the repeat footnote
text left blank.

[source,asciidoc]
----
Hello.footnote:abc[This is a footnote]

Repetition.footnote:abc[]
----

// end::inline-iho[]


== Metadata
// tag::document-history[]

Semantic markup of document history can be added to the document,
link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes#doc-history-misc-container[using Metanorma extension]
and Relaton YAML [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iho/releases/tag/v0.9.0].
The following information is required:

* The date of the document version.
* The version of the document.
* Description of changes.
* The (personal or corporate) author responsible for the changes.

The author is expected to be specified with an acronym (or initials, in the case of a person);
Relaton requires a proper name to be specified for contributors, but the `abbreviation` field
should be used alongside it.

The following illustrates what semantic markup of IHO document history should look like:
