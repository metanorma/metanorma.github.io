= Metanorma-ISO output formats

In addition to the normal output formats of Metanorma (`html`, `doc`, `pdf`),
Metanorma-ISO also supports the following output formats:

`html_alt`:: HTML output with a more Web-like rendering (whereas `html` abides by ISO document style as much as possible)
`sts`:: NISO STS XML
`isosts`:: ISO STS XML [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.5.6]

EXAMPLE:

[source,console]
----
metanorma -t iso -x html,html_alt,sts,isosts test.adoc
