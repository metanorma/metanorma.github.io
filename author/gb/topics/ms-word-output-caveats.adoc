= Caveats regarding MS Word output

The Word output is meticulously aligned to the GB/T 1.1 specification, which is highly
prescriptive on the positioning of elements on the page.

This means that the Word output
uses http://www.addbalance.com/word/frames_textboxes.htm[frames] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language[VML] extensively, as the best mechanism
Word HTML has to ensure precise positioning of elements. However, the use of frames
makes Word documents more cumbersome to edit; the bulk of document
editing should be happening in AsciiDoc, with Word treated as a write-only output format.

The use of VML and frames is mostly confined to the cover page, whose format is the most heavily
prescribed by GB/T 1.1. However, Word as of 2016 suppresses space before a paragraph
after a page break (though not a section break) -- which means that the Foreword, Introduction,
Document Title, Annex and Bibliography titles would all either lose their mandated initial
space in Word, or else would all have to be treated as separate sections.

For that reason,
those headings are instead treated by Metanorma-GB as frames (in-line with their following text),
which preserve their initial spacing.
