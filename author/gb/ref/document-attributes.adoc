[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma's processing of GB documents.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just GB.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

== Document info

`:title-intro-zh:`, `:title-main-zh:` (mandatory), `:title-part-zh:`::
These are the title introduction, main title, and part title in Chinese.
The intro and part titles are optional
(they replace their French counterparts in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso[metanorma-iso].)
This and the other `:title-*` document attributes are used instead
of the `metanorma-standoc` `:title:` attribute and the default AsciiDoc title
(the first line of the document header, prefixed with `=`).

`:title-intro-en:`, `:title-main-en:` (mandatory), `:title-part-en:`::
These are the title introduction, main title, and part title in English.
The intro and part titles are optional.
(They form the document subtitle, instead of the document title as in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso[metanorma-iso].)

`:scope:`::
The scope of the GB standard (`national`, `sector`, `professional`, `local`,
`enterprise`, `social-group`). Defaults to `national`.

`:mandate:`::
The mandate of the GB standard (`mandatory`, `recommended`, `guidelines`).
Defaults to `mandatory`.

`:topic:`::
The topic of the GB standard (`basic`, `health-and-safety`, `environment-protection`, `engineering-and-construction`, `product`, `method`, `management-techniques`, `other`). Defaults to `basic`.

=== Classification

`:prefix:`::
The prefix classifying the GB standard.
(Refer to
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-model-gb/blob/main/models/gb-standard-national-prefix.adoc[GB National Standard Prefixes],
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-model-gb/blob/main/models/gb-standard-sector-prefix.adoc[GB Sector Standard Prefixes],
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-model-gb/blob/main/models/gb-standard-local-prefix.adoc[GB Local Standard Prefixes],
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-gb/issues/54[GB Social and Enterprise Standard Prefixes].)
Any `/Z` or `/T` suffix (indicating "recommended" and "guidelines" mandate) is
ignored unless the `:mandate:` attribute is not given. Any `Q/` or `T/` prefix for social and enterprise
standards is ignored unless the `:scope:` attribute is not given.
If no prefix is given, `GB` is assumed.

`:library-ics:`::
The ICS (International Categorization for Standards) number for the GB standard. There may be more than one ICS for a document; if so, they should be comma-delimited. (Unlike the case for ISO, the ICS identifier is output to the front page of the GB standard.)

`:library-ccs:`::
The CCS (Chinese Categorization Scheme) code for the GB standard. See https://github.com/metanorma/cn-ccs-codes

`:plan-number:`::
The Plan Number (计划单号) for the GB standard.

=== Relations to other standards

`:iso-standard:`::
(optional) A corresponding ISO standard that the GB standard relates to. Format
is full document code, then optionally comma followed by document title;
e.g. `ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Information security management systems`

`:equivalence:`::
(optional, only valid if there is a corresponding `:iso-standard:`)
The relation of the GB standard to the corresponding ISO standard
(`equivalent`, `identical`, `nonequivalent`). Defaults to `equivalent`.

`:obsoletes:`::
(optional)
A corresponding GB standard that this GB standard obsoletes. Format is full
document code, then optionally comma followed by document title;
e.g. `GB/T 22080-2008`

`:obsoletes-parts:`::
A list of bibliographic localities in the corresponding GB standard that this
GB standard obsoletes. These are formatted the same way as the localities in
citations; e.g. `clause 7-9, clause 11`

== Author info

`:technical-committee-type:`::
The type of the technical committee (`technical` or `provisional`).

`:issuer:`::
The issuer of the standard. This is the authority which authors, manages, and issues the standard. For social standards, this is the social group; for enterprise standards, this is the company. The issuer appears on the standard frontispiece. By default, the issuer is inferred from the prefix of the standard; this attribute overrides the value inferred from the prefix. It is required for social and entperprise standards.

`:publisher:`::
The publisher of the standard, which distributes the standard. This is distinct from the issuer, the authority which authors, manages, and issues the standard.

`:proposer:`::
The party which proposed the standard.

`:authority:`::
The authority which sponsored the standard.

`:author:`::
The individuals who drafted the standard.

`:author-committee:`::
The committees which drafted the standard. (Also `:author-committee_2:`, `:author-committee_3:`...)

== Visual appearance

`:title-font:`::
The font to use for the standard class and issuer on the (Word) cover page; described in GB/T 1.1 as
"custom font". If not provided, the font is inferred from the scope of the standard, aligning
with existing practice: SimSun for national scope, SimHei for all other scopes.

`:keep-boilerplate:`::
If absent (default), any paragraphs supplied at the start of the Terms and Definitions
section are deleted, and replaced with standard predefined text. If present, any such
paragraphs in the text are retained.

`:standard-logo-img:`::
User-supplied graphic to overwrite the logo for the standard on the title page.

`:standard-class-img:`::
User-supplied graphic to overwrite the name of the standard class on the title page.

`:standard-issuer-img:`::
User-supplied graphic to overwrite the name of the standard issuer on the title page.
