= Metanorma IEC document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_iec]]
[NOTE]
====
Below are listed document attributes that are unique to Metanorma's processing
of IEC documents.

Generally, _document attributes for ISO_ also apply: refer to
link:/author/iso/ref/document-attributes[Metanorma-ISO document attributes]
for a detailed listing of attributes it shares with IEC.

For _common document attributes_, see
link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general
Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to
all Metanorma flavors, not just IEC.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how
Metanorma uses them, see
link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
====

NOTE: Document requirements stated in ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2018
(https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir2%7Bed8.0.RLV%7Den.pdf[IEC version (PDF link)],
https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO version (HTML link)])
apply equally to ISO and IEC deliverables.


== Parts and subparts

`:partnumber:`:: `{part}` or `{part}-{subpart}`

IEC documents can have both parts and subparts, unlike ISO documents
which only supports parts.

Both `{part}` and `{subpart}` only accept numerals.


== Document relations

=== Translated from

`translated-from`:: document identifier that the current document is a translation of.

IEC documents can be translated by IEC-CO and tagged with the
`translated-from` attribute. This is used to derive the correct status code.

See link:/author/ref/document-attributes[general Metanorma document attributes] for more information.


== Document type

`:doctype:`:: type of document. The permitted types are as follows.
+
NOTE: Unlike ISO, IEC does not have `international-workshop-agreement`,
and does have `interpretation-sheet`.

`international-standard`::: International Standard
`technical-specification`::: Technical Specification
`technical-report`::: Technical Report
`publicly-available-specification`::: Publicly Available Specification
`guide`::: Guide
`interpretation-sheet`.::: Interpretation Sheet

`:function:`:: function of document [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iec/releases/tag/v1.2.9].
Most documents do not have a category. The permitted types are as follows.

`emc`::: EMC
`safety`::: Safety
`environment`::: Environment
`quality-assurance`::: Quality assurance

`:horizontal:`:: whether the document is a horizontal standard [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iec/releases/tag/v1.2.9].
Allowed values below.

`true`::: Horizontal standard
`false`::: (default) Non-horizontal standard

== Project stage and substage of document

=== General

The project stage and substage can be entered in two ways shown below.

Not all IEC codes are represented -- those that are not are set by the IEC-CO (IEC Central Office)
rather than authors, or do not correspond to standards documents but to other
parts of the process (compilation of comments, reports on votes, translation, etc.),
are not represented here.

The following codes are ignored:

* PCC, PRVC, PRVDISH, PRVD, PRVDPAS, PRVDTR, PRVDTS, PRVN
* preDISH, prePNW, preCDPAS, preCD, preDTR
* DECDISH, DECFDIS, DECPUB
* TCDV, TDISH, TDTR, TDTS, TFDIS, TPUB
* RPUB
* DEL
* MERGED, DREJ
* ADISSB, APUBSB


=== Via ISO International Harmonized Stage Codes

`:docstage:`:: project stage code of document
`:docsubstage:`:: project substage code of document

The codes in the first entry form are drawn from the
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[ISO International Harmonized Stage Codes].

The mapping to IEC stage codes is taken from
https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir1-consolidatediecsup%7Bed15.0.RLV%7Den.pdf[ISO/IEC DIR 1:2019 + IEC SUP:2019, Annex SH],
updated against the current discussion of stage codes in
https://www.iec.ch/standards-development/stage-codes[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Stage Codes] and
https://www.iec.ch/standards-development/workflows[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Workflow].


The following codes are supported:

=== Via project stage abbreviation

`:stage`:: project stage abbreviation

An IEC project stage abbreviation code entered under `:stage:` will be recognised,
and broken down into the corresponding ISO harmonized stage and substage codes
shown in the table automatically.

For example, `:stage: ACD` is equivalent to setting `:docstage: 20` and `:docsubstage: 99`.

In the case of A2CD... A9CD and 2CD... 9CD, the numeral value of the `:iteration:` attribute
will also be set accordingly.

For example, `:stage: 8CD` is equivalent to setting `:docstage: 35`, `:docsubstage: 20` and `:iteration: 8`.

== Cover page attributes

`:accessibility-color-inside:`:: indication that document contains colour content
(default: `false`) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iec/releases/tag/v1.2.10]

`:price-code:`:: price code group of publication, as documented in the
https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/tools/pdf/IEC_DATA_FEEDS.pdf[IEC Data Feeds: Technical documentation document] [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iec/releases/tag/v1.2.10]

`:cen-processing:`:: CEN (European Committee for Standardization) processing
(default: `false`) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iec/releases/tag/v1.2.11]

`:secretary:`:: Secretary of the secretariat [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iec/releases/tag/v1.2.12].
