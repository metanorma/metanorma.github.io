= Metanorma BSI document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ieee]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of BSI documents
in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just IEEE SA.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

== Document types

The following document types are recognised in the `:doctype:` document attribute:

BSI document types::
+
--
* `british-standard`
* `draft-for-development`
* `published-document`
* `privately-subscribed-standard`
* `publicly-available-specification`
* `flex-standard`
--

Adoptable types, ISO::
+
--
* `international-standard`
* `technical-specification`
* `technical-report`
* `guide`
* `publicly-available-specification`
* `international-workshop-agreement`
--


Adoptable types, IEC::
+
--
* `international-standard`
* `technical-specification`
* `technical-report`
* `industry-technical-agreement`
--

Adoptable types, CEN and CENELEC::
+
--
* `standard`
* `technical-specification`
* `technical-report`
* `guide`
* `european-workshop-agreement`
--

The following document types are recognized in the `:docsubtype:` document attribute:

* `specification`
* `method-of-test`
* `method-of-specifying`
* `vocabulary`
* `code-of-practice`

== Document numbers

In the case of native BS standards, the identifier is compiled from a combination of the `doctype`,
`docnumber`, and `copyright-year` document attributes, with a numeric `docnumber` value.

So

[source,adoc]
----
:docnumber: 1000
:doctype: publicly-available-specification
:copyright-year: 2021
----

generates the document identifier "PAS 1000:2021".

In the case of document adoptions, the `docidentifier` attribute should be used (to which `BS` will be prefixed),
instead of assembling an identifier out of components, so that the source document identifier can be built up accurately.

Part numbers of the original document should also be included in the `docidentifier` attribute,
instead of being named with the `partnumber` attribute.

So

[source,adoc]
----
:docidentifier: ISO/TR 123-2:1985
:doctype: technical-report
----

generates the document identifier "BS ISO/TR 123-2:1985".

Note that the `:copyright-year:` attribute is added to the identifier of a native BSI document,
but not to that of an adopted document. So a 2022 adoption of ISO 123:1985 will still have the identifer
"BS ISO 123:1985".

== Related BSI Standards

The frontispiece of BSI Standards includes text like the following:

____
The following BSI references relate to the work on this document: +
Committee reference DEF/1 +
Draft for comment 20/30387670 DC
____

This text is created by adding the BSI list of documents that the document relates to
as a semicolon-delimited list of references, using `:bsi-related:`:

[source,adoc]
----
:bsi-related: Committee reference DEF/1;Draft for comment 20/30387670 DC
----

The introductory phrase is added automatically.

== Adoption of standard

An adopted external standard is defined as `:adopted-from:`:

[source,adoc]
----
:docidentifier: NA to BS EN 1991-1-2
:adopted-from: EN 1991-1-2
----


[source,adoc]
----
:docidentifier: BS ISO 639-2
:adopted-from: ISO 639-2
----

The identifier for such adoptions is generated based on the `:adopted-from:` value, if
`:docidentifier:` is not supplied.

== Expert Commentaries

Expert commentaries are of type `:doctype: expert-commentary`, and are commentaries of another
document; the related document is indicated with `:annotation-of:`.

The author of the commentary is indicated as the author of the document, including credentials
(indicated with `:contributor-credentials:`) and their position (`:contributor-position:`) and
possibly organizational affiliation (`:affiliation:`). The position can be discursive.

[source,adoc]
----
:docidentifier: BS ISO 639-2
:annotation-of: ISO 639-2
:fullname: Eamonn Hoxey
:contributor-credentials: PhD, F.R.Pharm.S.
:contributor-position: Vice President, Medical Devices Quality & Compliance -- Strategic programmes, Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd, Former Chair ISO TC 210, Quality management and related general aspects for medical devices, and Principal UK Expert to ISO TC 210 WG 1, Quality Management Systems.
:role: author

== Visual appearance

`:coverpage-image:`:: Comma-delimited list of image locations, for images to be included on the PDF cover page. All image locations are relative to the source document.
`:innercoverpage-image:`:: Same, for images to be included on the PDF inside cover page.
`:tocside-image:`:: Same, for images to be included on the PDF Table of Contents side page.
`:backpage-image:`:: Same, for images to be included on the PDF back page.

`:presentation-metadata-color-cover-background:`:: Background colour on PDF front cover (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-cover-title:`:: Title colour on PDF front cover (PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-secondary-shade-1:`:: Colour on PDF text accents (headings, titles and odd table header rows, BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-secondary-shade-2:`:: Colour (lighter accents) on PDF even (odd for preface) table header rows (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-secondary-shade-3:`:: Colour (even lighter accents) on PDF odd (even for preface) table body rows (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-secondary-shade-4:`:: Colour (much lighter accent) for background on PDF preface and even table body rows (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-list-label:`:: List item bullet and label colour (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.
`:presentation-metadata-color-clause-union-background:`:: Background colour on clauses under floating titles (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX
`:presentation-metadata-color-backpage-background:`:: Background colour on PDF back cover (BSI Flex and PAS only), as #HEX.

`:presentation-metadata-layout-columns:`:: Alternate between one-column and two-column output; default is `1`. `2` is expected for PAS documents authored before 2023.

`:toclevels:`::
Number of table of contents levels to render. Accepts an integer value. (default: `1` for BSI).
Can be overridden with output-specific options (`htmltoclevels`, `doctoclevels`).

`:htmltoclevels:`::
Number of table of contents levels to render in HTML output; used to override
`:toclevels:` for HTML output. Accepts an integer value. (default: `1` for BSI).

`:doctoclevels:`::
Number of table of contents levels to render in Microsoft Word "DOC" output;
used to override `:toclevels:` for Word DOC output. Accepts an integer value.
(default: `1` for BSI).

`:document-scheme:`::
Picks the form of document presentation to be used. If `with-publication-information` is given,
the document history of the document is given in the old style, with full publication history
(enumerating all editions), and with four columns for amendments (date issued, date effective,
amendment designation, description). If it is not, the document history is given in the new style:
no publication history, and two columns for amendments (date issued, description). The
scheme is ignored in Flex and PAS, which use full document history, but two columns for amendments.
