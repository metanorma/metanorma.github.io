= AsciiMath support

Metanorma uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/AsciiMath[Ruby AsciiMath parser]
to process AsciiMath, converting it to MathML for Metanorma processing. For rendering in
HTML, the MathML generated is processed by https://www.mathjax.org[MathJax]. For rendering
in Word, the MathML is converted to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML[Office Open XML (OOXML)].

NOTE: AsciiMath only recognises decimal points and not decimal commas. Any attempt to use
a decimal comma (e.g. _3,4_) will be processed as an operator, and will end up treating the integer and fractional
parts of the number as two separate numerals, separated by a space as well as a comma. This
applies to all versions of Asciimath.

== Ruby AsciiMath

The version of AsciiMath supported by the Ruby AsciiMath parser is slightly different
to other variants of AsciiMath. The following are differences between Ruby AsciiMath
and the version of AsciiMath
documented on http://asciimath.org[asciimath.org]:

=== Miscellaneous symbols:

Ruby AsciiMath adds the following as distinct symbols:

`dx`:: dx identifier

`dy`:: dy identifier

`dz`:: dz identifier

`dt`:: dt identifier

`...`:: ... operator

`"\ "`:: non-breaking space

`qquad`:: four non-breaking spaces (just as `quad` is processed as two non-breaking spaces)

`lim`:: lim operator
`Lim`:: Lim operator

`'`:: prime operator, &#x2032;

`:'`:: &#x2235;

`/_\`:: &#x25b3;

`frown`:: &#x2322;

=== Relation symbols

Ruby AsciiMath adds the following as distinct symbols:

`:=`:: := operator

=== Operation symbols

`setminus`:: \
`divide`:: &#xf7;
`:|:`:: | as operator


=== Logical symbols

No difference.


=== Grouping brackets
Ruby AsciiMath adds the following as distinct brackets:

`|:`:: | as left bracket
`:|`:: | as right bracket


=== Arrows

No difference.

=== Accents

The following operators are currently missing from Ruby AsciiMath:

* `color(red)(x)`
* `cancel(x)`

Ruby AsciiMath adds the following as distinct accents

`tilde`:: ~
`overarc`:: &#x23dc;

=== Greek letters

The Ruby AsciiMath gem supports several capital letter symbols, which are not named
in asciimath.org:

`Alpha`:: Alpha

`Beta`:: Beta

`Epsilon`:: Epsilon

`Zeta`:: Zeta

`Eta`:: Eta

`Iota`:: Iota

`Kappa`:: Kappa

`Mu`:: Mu

`Nu`:: Nu

`Rho`:: Rho

`Tau`:: Tau

`Upsilon`:: Upsilon

`Chi`:: Chi

=== Standard functions

No difference.

=== Font commands

The following are font commands supported by the Ruby AsciiMath gem, in addition
to those named in asciimath.org:

`ii`:: italic font
`bii`:: bold italic font
`bcc`:: bold script font
`bfr`:: bold fraktur font
`bsf`:: bold sans serif font
`sfi`:: italic sans serif font
`sfbi`:: sans serif bold italic font

== Conversion to Word OOXML

AsciiMath and MathJax processors are tolerant of loose syntax in mathematical expressions.
Currently the conversion of MathML to OOXML is not as tolerant: if a mathematical operator
takes a single argument, the OOXML expects to find that argument brackets as a single entity.
If that does not happen, Word displays a dotted square where it would expect the single
argument to appear. To remedy this, you will need to bracket the argument of the operator
in invisible brackets (`{:`, `:}`).

For example, the following AsciiMath displays correctly in HTML under MathJax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem]
++++
bar X' = (1)/(v) sum_(i = 1)^v t_i
++++
--

However, it displays incorrectly in Word with an extraneous "`square`":

That is because the `sum` operator expects to find a single expression as its argument,
but `t_i` is processed as two tokens. To get this expression processed correctly for
Word, you will need to bracket `t_i`:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem]
++++
bar X' = (1)/(v) sum_(i = 1)^v {:t_i:}
++++
--

and it should display correctly as:
