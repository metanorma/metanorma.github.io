= Clause and block-level attributes

== Language and script

The language and script of a section is indicated via the optional attributes
`language` and `script`:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[language=fr]
== Section 3

[appendix,script=Zmth]
== Math Appendix
--

== Obligations

The obligation of a section -- whether it is normative or informative -- is indicated
via the attribute `obligation` (see example below).

For most sections, this is fixed; for annexes and clauses,
the default value of the obligation is "normative" and users need to set the obligation
to "informative" as a section attribute if needed. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[AnnexA]]
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Determination of defects
--

=== Type

Clauses can have types. In Metanorma, clause types are normally set internally
(e.g. all clauses with the title "Scope" or `heading=` attribute "scope" are of
type "scope").

The type of a clause can also be explicitly set by the user through the `type`
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.4].

This is useful particularly for any semantic processing of the document
downstream.

[type=reagents]

== Numbering

As with link:/author/topics/document-format/text#numbering-override[block element numbering],
a clause number may be provided to override auto-numbering.

For instance, in order to number out-of-sequence clauses in updated
documents or amendments [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.3].

A manual clause number is specified with the attribute `number`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Clause 7

[number=0]
=== Zeroth Subclause
----

This subclause will be numbered as clause 7.0: the supplied number is the number of just this subclause.

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Clause 7
[number=6.2.1]
=== Zeroth Subclause
----

Elements subsequent to the manually numbered element will be auto-numbered
so as to follow the previous element. This may include incrementing the final
letter in an alphanumeric clause number (e.g. _7a_ followed by _7b_.)

If resumption of auto-numbering is not intended for subsequent clauses
(e.g. _7bis_ should not be followed by _7bit_),
an explicit number also needs to be given to those clauses separately.

If a value needs to be supplied for the entire hierarchical branch, that value is given as 
`branch-number` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.6.3].

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Clause 7
[branch-number=6.2.1]
=== Zeroth Subclause
=== First subclause
----

This subclause will be numbered as 6.2.1, not 7.6.2.1. Any subsequent clauses will be numbered
as if the branch-number clause was not there; 6.2.1 in the example just given will be followed
by the expected 7.1.

`branch-number` can also be used when an atomic section number is required, as can occur in
terms and definitions sections inheriting their term identifiers from a termbase.

If numbering is to be skipped for a clause, that can be indicated with an `%unnumbered`
option on the clause, as with blocks; that atttribute will result in all child clauses also
being unnumbered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.8].

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%unnumbered]
== Clause 7
=== Zeroth Subclause
=== First subclause
----

Because of the importance of clause referencing in standards, making a clause unnumbered is not
recommended.

== Inline headings

Inline subclause headings (e.g. for test methods) are indicated by preceding the heading
with the `[%inline-header]` option attribute. So in the Rice Model document,

[source,asciidoc]
--
[%inline-header]
==== Sieve,

with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
--

renders as

____
*A.2.1.1. Sieve,* with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
____

// Dump 2 from existing docs


== Paragraph alignment

Paragraph alignment is defined as the `align` attribute for paragraphs.

[example]
.Examples of possible paragraph alignments
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[align=left]
This paragraph is aligned left

[align=center]
This paragraph is aligned center

[align=right]
This paragraph is aligned right

[align=justified]
This paragraph is justified, which is the default
--

renders:

====

If the paragraph contains line breaks, and the default alignment in the
stylesheet is justified (as is often the case in Word output), it is necessary
to specify `[align=left]` to make the paragraph look as normally expected.

[example]
.Example of a paragraph containing line breaks that needs to be left-aligned
