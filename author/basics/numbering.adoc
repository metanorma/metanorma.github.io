== Automatic numbering

=== General
tag::auto-num-intro[]

Metanorma supports auto-numbering for the following types of document elements ("`elements`"):

* figures
* tables
* examples
* notes
* formulas
* sourcecode, pseudocode
* permissions, recommendations and requirements.

NOTE: Users do not need to specify any numbering of these elements in their
source documents.

The conventions for numbering vary by Metanorma flavour, but the
default is to number all elements consecutively in the main body of a document, and
separately in each Annex/Appendix, prefixed bt the Annex/Appendix number.

NOTE: Typical AsciiDoc only supports auto-numbering of some block types, like
tables and figures.


=== Multi-level numbering

Metanorma's auto-numbering functionality assigns numbers to elements consecutively.
Sometimes, more than one level of numbering is required for a sequence of elements;
for instance, _17a_, _17b_.

To indicate that, all elements in the subsequence should be assigned the same
`subsequence` attribute of an autonumbered document element.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[{block-type},subsequence={subsequence-id}]
--

Where:

* `{block-type}` is type of the document block
* `{subsequence-id}` is the subsequence identifier

[example]

[stem,subsequence=B]
++++

[stem,subsequence=B]

++++

++++
E

--

renders as:

____
A (1a)

B (1b)

C (2a)

D (2b)

E (3)

=== Unnumbered elements

Sometimes a document element needs to be excluded from auto-numbering.
This is achieved by giving it the option attribute `%unnumbered`.

Sourcecode and pseudocode snippets are by default numbered as figures
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.0.10]. If they
are not to be numbered, they need to be given the `%unnumbered` option attribute.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
// shorthand
[%unnumbered]
image::...[]

// with other options
[options="unnumbered"]
image::...[]

// block type with shorthand
[{block-type}%unnumbered]
image::...[]

// block type with other options
[{block-type},options="unnumbered"]
image::...[]
--

Where:

* `{block-type}` is type of the document block;
* The `%` symbol is a shorthand for `options="unnumbered"`.

NOTE: The `%` shorthand cannot be used in the presence of block arguments or
attributes, such as `[source,c]` or `[source,type="..."]`. In this case, the
`options="unnumbered"` should be spelled out.

Numbering can be suppressed for all instances of a Metanorma XML block type
throughout a document, through the document attribute `:block-unnumbered:`,
which takes as its argument a comma-delimited list of Metanorma XML block
names [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v2.4.6]:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:block-unnumbered: sourcecode, figure
----

A block instance will remain numbered if it is explicitly set to
`unnumbered=false`, or if it has a manually set anchor (recognised as not
prefixed with an underscore --- `[[_anchor]]` will be ignored) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v2.4.9].


=== Prevention of double-numbering

If a document element is included in a block type that is already subject to
numbering, it will be excluded from auto-numbering.

This means that tables, sourcecode and pseudocode, and figures are
excluded from auto-numbering within
examples, requirements, recommendations, permissions, tables, figures,
sourcecode and pseudocode.

[[numbering-override]]
=== Override numbering

There are circumstances when auto-numbering of elements needs to be overriden;
for instance, numbering out of sequence in updated documents.

In these cases, elements can be given an optional `number`
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1],
assigning a required document element number to override auto-numbering.

Elements subsequent to that element will be auto-numbered so as to
follow the previous element, so long as the supplied number belongs
to the same sequence.

For subsequences, number shall have only subsequence scope.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[{block-type},number={number-to-use}]
--

Where:

* `{block-type}` is type of the document block
* `{number-to-use}` is an integer specifying at which number to use
