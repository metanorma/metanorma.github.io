Let's check out what happens when we compile `exercise-3-2.adoc`
To compile our document: 

. Open a new terminal
. Start Docker using Docker Desktop.
. Go to the directory where your Metanorma document(s) are stored. For example: 
+ 
[source,sh]
----
$ cd Documents/Metanorma/metanorma-tutorial
----
. Start the container and compile the document. To learn more about the command syntax and options, read the https://www.metanorma.org/software/metanorma-cli/docs/usage/[metanorma-cli documentation].
+
NOTE: The https://github.com/fontist/fontist[fontist] automatically installs all needed fonts. The `--agree-to-terms` option agrees to all font license agreements that come up during the compilation process. If you don't set this option, you will be asked to agree to the licenses during the compilation process which might break it.
+
.Docker on Linux and macOS
[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma/ -w /metanorma metanorma/metanorma metanorma compile -t ogc exercises/exercise-3-2.adoc --agree-to-terms

The following document doesn't compile because there are some errors. 

. Enter `metnanorma exercise-4-2.adoc` to trigger the build process.
. Have a look at the error messages. 
. Try to debug the document. If you get stuck, have a look at the hints. 
. Once you solved the errors, run the compilation command again to see if the document is build.

.Hint Error 1
[%collapsible]
====
Lines 47 and 66: Both sections have the anchor `\[[prefatory-clause]]` assigned.
You can solve this error by renaming one of the anchors.
====

.Hint Error 2
[%collapsible]
====
Line 76: The file that should be included cannot be found.
Since the scope section already contains text, you can delete the reference. 
====

.Hint Error 3
[%collapsible]
====
Line 236: The image attribute contains a whitespace after `image::`, so the path is invalid. Delete the whitespace.
