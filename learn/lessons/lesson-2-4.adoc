To annotate single words, you use inline markup. The markup encloses the word(s) and you do not need to begin a new line. Inline markup allows you to:

* Emphasize text
* Link to external resources with hyperlinks
* Create internal cross-references
* Create index entries
* Create Bibliographic entries

Let’s look at these features in the following lessons.
