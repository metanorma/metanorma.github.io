title: Rendering a draft document
---
:page-liquid:

To render a draft that your peers should review, you need to add these metadata to the document header:

* `:draft:`: Tells the compiler to display comments in the final output
* `:status: draft` Defines the current document stage. +
NOTE: Some flavors, for example ISO, use `:docstage:` and a status code to indicate in what stage the document is.

To compile a Metanorma document you must enter the name of the application `Metanorma` and the document you want to compile `document.adoc`. 

[source, shell]
----
Metanorma document.adoc
----
With this command you trigger the Metanorma toolchain to:

* Read the AsciiDoc input
* Convert it into XML
* Check the XML against the document model (XML schema)
* Create HTML, PDF, and DOC output

== Practice time

{% include_relative /exercises.adoc content="exercise-3-2" %}

Now that you are familiar with the simplest way of creating a Metanorma document, let's look at different ways to compile documents in the next lesson.
