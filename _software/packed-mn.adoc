Metanorma is distributed as a single executable in binary form for Windows,
macOS and Linux for painless installs.

Metanorma is written in a combination of languages, and the single executable
approach includes all necessary dependencies within a binary file
using the https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako[Tebako] cross-platform
executable packager.

This repository is only intended to be used by Metanorma developers or
users who wish to build their own Metanorma executables for distribution.

NOTE: The Metanorma single executable includes only
link:/flavors#default-flavors[default flavors] due to file size considerations.
To see the list of included flavors, run the command `metanorma version`.
To use other flavors, please consult the usage guide.
