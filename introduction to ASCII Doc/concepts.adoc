== Concepts
=== Auto-numbering
In Metanorma, we provide the system of automatically assigning numbers to the various elements in a document to refrain the users from manually updating them. The elements in a document that are auto-numbered are:
 * Figures
 * Tables
 * Examples
 * Formulas
 * Sourcecode, Psudeocode
 * Permissions, Recommendations, and requirements
 
[NOTE]
The conventions for auto-numbering differ from flavor to flavor. But the underlying concept of numbering each element consecutively in the main document by default and separately in each Appendix, remains the same. 

==== Multi-level Numbering
To add multiple levels of numbers to an element in the document, you can use the subsequence  attribute. 
For instance, 
[source,console]
----
[stem,subsequence=A]
++++
A
++++

[stem,subsequence=A]
++++
B
++++

[stem,subsequence=B]
++++
C
++++

[stem,subsequence=B]
++++
D
++++

[stem]
++++
E
++++

----

This renders as:
A (1a)
B (1b)
C (2a)
D (2b)
E (3)

==== Unnumbered Elements
If you wish to exclude a few elements in the document from auto-numbering, then use 
[source,console]
----
%unnumbered
----

For instance, 
[source,console]
----
[[figureC-1]]
[%unnumbered]
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[]
----

For excluding numbers from sourcecode and psuedocode that automatically get numbered is by adding [sourcecode%unnumbered] before the code. 
For instance, 

[sourcecode%unnumbered]
----
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { bounce(v[i], wall) }
----

// This is also unnumbered
[%unnumbered]
[pseudocode]
----
stem:[forall v_{i}] *bounce* stem:[v_{i}] off the wall
----

The two use-cases where auto-numbering might not work: 

.Blocking auto numbering– 
If the element is already included in a block type subject to numbering, it will not be applicable for auto-numbering. So, if you define elements like tables, figures, sourcecode, and pseudocode within other elements (tables, figures, requirements, recommendations, source code, pseudocode, or permissions), then they will not be auto-numbered. 

.Override numbering––
But when you update a document and want to provide numbers manually over auto-numbering, you can specify the number by giving an optional attribute number. 

[sourcecode,number=7]
----
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { bounce(v[i], wall) }
